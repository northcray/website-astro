for sending the following message :

Throughout the year we receive several emails in relation to illegal fishing in the meadows and other areas of the ward, we have spoken with the council regarding this and have reviewed the following information, could I possibly ask you to pass this out to your members and maybe display it on the meadows please?

Many thanks for your help.
