Stolen car found in St James Way

A VW Sirocco was parked outside member's house in St James Way for three weeks. It had not been moved or visited in the same time and was in too good a condition to have been dumped.

Suspecting that it was a stolen car, our member, Jim Longbon, asked us to report the car to a relevant authority. We passed his message to the local Safer Neighbourhood Team and they came round the next day. The car had been reported stolen by a finance company.

If anyone has a similar experience with a suspect car, the local Safer Neighbourhood Team can be contacted directly by telephone : 07843 291106
