If you attended our February Quiz night, thanks very much for your support. It was a great evening with 14 teams and 68 quizzers answering 80 thought provoking (but not too difficult) questions.

The next Quiz Night is on 7th March at the White Cross as usual starting at 8.00pm.

If you are interested in joining us for what will be a fun evening, please book with the pub directly either by phone on 020 8300 2590 or call in and talk to the bar staff.

When you book please don't forget to tell them if you are having a meal.
