Planning Application- Brookworth Homes

The Planning Committee unanimously refused this application at their evening meeting on 6th October 2016.

This is not necessarily the end of our concern about this attempt to develop this land:-

- Brookworth Homes could decide to appeal to the Secretary of State/Planning Inspectorate.

- Or they could come back later with a different proposal and try again.
