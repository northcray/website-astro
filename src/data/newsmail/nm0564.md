Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to PCSO Angel Parnell for the following update :

| A co-ordinator has informed us that upon returning home on Friday he noticed that the lawn in his front garden had been cut by person/s unknown, Later, during the evening he spotted a white van with 2 people in parked opposite his property. They stayed there for 30 mins before driving off and passing the house again. The occupants of this vehicle may be totally unconnected but it is possible that they had returned to collect money for cutting the lawn which they took upon themselves to do. Beware of cold callers offering to carry out work. If you experience a caller visiting saying that they have carried out gardening or maintenance services without your knowledge and demanding payment dial 999 immediately giving as much of a description as possible.          |
