Email to North Cray Residents Association Committee

Thanks to a member in St James Way for sending the following message :

On Saturday evening at 22:17 we had someone walk down our drive checking out our side gate and then last night at 00:44 a man came down our drive trying the doors of both our cars and then climbed over our neighbours wall and checked out their cars too.

He then climbed over the neighbours front wall and drove off in a white Fiat 500.

Please be vigilant.

We only know this has happened as we have a Ring doorbell that notifies us of intruders.
