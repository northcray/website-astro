NEWS FROM THE SECRETARY - a new 'Local Plan for Bexley'

The Council has been consulting local people, businesses, landowners and developers on its proposed new Local Plan. The consultation document set out the preferred approaches for strategic and development management policies and the arrangement and designation of land use in the borough.

It proposes an open, transparent and proactive approach to shaping, considering, determining and delivering development proposals in accordance with broad principles set out in the Council's Growth Strategy.

This is a key planning document which the Council aims to update every five years. National Government produces the overarching framework, the Mayor of London produces a London Plan and Bexley's document is third in that hierarchy.

The consultation period ended on 7 April 2019. The Council will now look carefully at all the views received, and then publish a Draft Local Plan later in the year. Once adopted, the new Bexley Local Plan, will replace the Bexley Core Strategy and Saved UDP policies 2012.
