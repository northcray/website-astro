Cygnets - another incident

Thanks to Alex for this report :

I'm sorry to advise that this morning I witnessed another dog attack on the swans and cygnets as I cross the five arch bridge. A shaved headed man, middle aged man, wearing a grey t-shirt and camouflage shorts allowed his spaniel to approach and attack the swans. The cygnets were again targeted, which the father swan tried to prevent, and was also attacked. The dog owner did very little to prevent or stop this and sauntered slowly towards the attack and then off with his dog.

There are only two cygnets. The attack reported yesterday has clearly claimed another one.
