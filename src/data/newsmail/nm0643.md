| From PC Mark Laker, Police SNT Team <br>We have had a spate of Burglaries where properties have been targeted for vehicles parked outside. These are not just expensive high-powered vehicles and have included old Ford Fiestas too. On all occasions entry has been gained via the front UPVC door which have not been double locked. If the door is not double locked it will take the average person literally seconds to force open the door leaving little or no damage. Please can you assist by getting the message out there to residents that UPVC doors must be secured by double locking. Insurance companies are getting wise to the fact that these doors are not being secured correctly and will refuse to pay out. As far as they are concerned the property has been left insecure and as such the terms and conditions of most polices have been breached . The message we must get out is LIFT the handle, LOCK with a key and make sure the door is SECURE: LIFT - LOCK - SECURE. |
| From PC Augustine Gomes, Police SNT Team <br>Having your car broken into and losing your things to thieves can be very distressing. Here are a few simple steps you can take to keep your vehicle, and what's in it, safe. 1. Always lock it. 2. Close windows and the sun roof to prevent 'fishing'. 3. Secure your number plates with tamper-resistant screws. 4. Fit locking, anti-tamper wheel nuts to secure alloy wheels. 5. Secure anything that's on the outside of your vehicle. 6. Take it with you or hide it. 7. Hide electrical items and leave no clues. 8. Take your documents with you. 9. Park in well-lit and busier areas. 10. Choose your car park wisely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
