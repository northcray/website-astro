I am writing to update you about the Neighbourhood of the Year Award 2018 nomination process that we sent you an earlier message about last week. (If you received a previous message about this award earlier today please disregard that one as the e-mail address on that message was incorrect - please use the e-mail address below instead).

Due to technical restrictions and for data protection reasons, the initial nomination process required those wishing to nominate their neighbour to sign up as a Co-op member. We have reviewed this process in partnership with the Co-op and have resolved the issue so that anyone can now nominate their neighbour for this award without having to join the Coop.

If you do not wish to become a Co-op member, but would like to nominate your neighbour, please e-mail [neighbourawards@ourwatch.org.uk](mailto:neighbourawards@ourwatch.org.uk)

to request a nomination form. Once the form is completed it can then be returned to the same e-mail address for processing. The winner of the award will be announced in early October, at which point you will be contacted by Neighbourhood Watch Network should your nominated neighbour be successful. Please note that the deadline for returning completed nominations is midnight on 5th September 2018
