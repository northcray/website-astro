(1) Flight Ticket Fraud Alert

Thanks to Neighbourhood Alert for sending the following warning issued today by Fraud Alert :

Fraudsters are attempting to entice victims who are looking for cheap flights abroad.

Victims have reported booking tickets via websites or a 'popular' ticket broker, only to discover that after payment via bank transfer or electronic wire transfer, the tickets/booking references received are counterfeit.

In some cases, all communications between the company or broker and the victim have been severed.
