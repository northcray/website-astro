Another Local Incident Report :

Thanks to the NCRA Member who sent the following message :

Hi, Just to let you know there was an incident outside our house last night on the grove.

A driver claimed that someone had blocked the road on him, he reversed knocking over a tree where the car got stuck.

He claimed someone smashed his passenger window. He asked us to call the police and then him and the passenger ran off down the spinney.

Police attended the scene but I don't know what happened next.

Please don't put my name on this as a very aggressive exchange was heard by another neighbour before they all ran off.
