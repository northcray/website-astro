The Little Book Of Big Scams

Further to our NewsMail of 24 April, our volunteers have now delivered these to most members but unfortunately it proved impossible to arrange for a Volunteer to deliver the above booklet to our members in the North Cray Road.

However, if any such member cares to email [The Committee](mailto:committee@northcrayresidents.org.uk) with name and house number one of us will deliver a copy as soon as we can.
