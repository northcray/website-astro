Message from a member in The Grove.

Good afternoon,

I was wondering if you could send an Email out please, on Wednesday (I think) around lunch time there was black BMW X5 displaying the vrn CX08 SXV sitting outside my house looking at my vans.

I jumped over my wall and come out and they was on the phone and drove off. I got the plate and check it and it come back proper.

I have since learnt that the vehicle in question is displaying cloned plates and has been involved in vehicle thefts in the borough.

I was wondering if anyone had any cctv on the grove?

Regards Grant 63 the grove
