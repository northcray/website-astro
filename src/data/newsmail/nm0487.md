| The team held a street briefing on 30/3/2018 near Maylands Drive. Due to the horrendous weather, only a few people turned up. The team still gave out the crime figures for all the roads included in the street briefing. The team also answered any questions that were put to them. The next street briefing will take place on 4th May 2018 at 17.30 hrs. This will take place on the grass area on the junction with Pembury Crescent / Burham Road. If you reside near to this area please pop along. It's very informative and the feedback we are receiving has been very promising. Don't forget we will be coming to an area near you soon so keep an eye out on your post. |
| The team are continuing to work alongside the council / RSPCA regarding the horses on the waste ground adjacent to Edgington Road. RSPCA are looking at sorting this problem out this week at some point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
