| NCRA Position     | Objection â€“ a backland development severely impacting on the amenities of neighbouring properties; and a serious threat to a centuries-old Cedar tree protected by an Tree Preservation Order (TPO).                    |

This is a planning application that has just been received in respect of a new housing development by Brookworth Homes.

The text of the NCRA's proposed letter of Objection to Bexley Planning will be issued as a GroupMail as soon as possible, together with the deadline for comments (currently under negotiation with Planning) and a list of key bullet points that members may like to use in support.

Meanwhile, members may like to go to Bexley Council-Home and call up under Planning the 32 documents that have been submitted by the applicant.
