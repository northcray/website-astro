Lost Wheelie Bin - update

We have received an update from a member in The Spinney :

re no44 the spinney looking their bin I saw a white van park opposite no45 and a man got out and walked across the grass and wheeled the bin to a white van and put it in the side door. Unfortunately I was unable to get the registration number.we obviously need to keep a look out for the future.

If anyone else saw this white van and can recall the number, please let us know and we will pass the details to the local SNT Police Team.
