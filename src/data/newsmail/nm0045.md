To NCRA Members :

Ormond Davies

It is with great sadness we announce that Ormond Davies, one of NCRA's longest members, sadly passed away on Wednesday evening at the grand old age of 100.

Ormond and his wife Joy have always been members of the NCRA and in the past have been very active in the community.

They were members of St James's for many years where Joy ran the Sunday school and Ormond did the accounts.

We offer our deepest condolences to his wife Joy and to all of Ormond's family.
