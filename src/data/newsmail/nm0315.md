| Residential Burglary - 16/10/2017 - 1250 hrs - Sidcup Hill - Entry via front porch (the glass on inner door had been smashed) - At this stage a list was being made by owners as to what has been stolen. A neighbour nearby reported a few minutes before that 2 white males had knocked on their door asking for 'James'. These males were both wearing crash helmets so no identification has been made. They were caught on CCTV and this investigation is still ongoing |
| On other wards there is a increase in burglaries and motor vehicle crime. Please be mindful when you go out of your home that everything is locked up including windows. Do not leave any keys visible. Any items of jewellery you may have should either be placed in a Safe locked securely away or in a safe deposit box elsewhere. Please do not leave currency in the house.                                                                                            |
