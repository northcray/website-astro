New Rails Around The Meadows

NCRA has received a number of emails from members expressing their concern about the new rails currently being erected around the meadows and the lack of pedestrian access.

We raised this issue with Bexley and can have now received a response from Patrick English confirming that the fencing workers will provide entrances at the junction of The Grove and Spinney and just past the bend going north along The Grove.

Our thanks to Patrick English for his help..
