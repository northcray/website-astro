White powder

Thanks to Candy Rolton who sent the following message :

Sunday ... been for walk along the horse track . Clumps of dry white powder intermittently placed on track. Could be in other places.

Phoned borough on my return and told to phone police. Police now aware.

Please warn other dog owners. It may be nothing but better safe than sorry.

Whilst I cannot be positive on this occasion, I do know that previous examples of equally spaced clumps of white powder have been identified as flour used by running clubs to leave a trail for runners to follow on an organised 'Steeple Chase'.

This is generally considered 'Greener' than the older more traditional practice of leaving a trail of torn up paper for steeple chasers to follow.
