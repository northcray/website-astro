My Message is : At 7:10 this morning I have walked across five arches bridge where there was a man setting up a canoe. I asked him if he planning using it on the river and he said yes.I explained that was illegal and to check out the sign but was basically told to mind my own business. I asked if he worked for the council and he told me it didn't matter who he worked for and that I should continue on my way to work!! He claimed to be collecting rubbish off the river but I'm not convinced.
