Further to our NewsMail re. Thames Water

Thanks to Shirley Wallace for sending the following information :

Just to let you know that Thames Water have been visiting homes in Maidstone Road after fitting new water meters and the visits were arranged by phone call.

The engineer filled out paperwork whilst visiting our home and left water saving devices.

The visit was called a 'smarter home visit' and we have since received a follow up letter and water/energy saving report from Thames Water.

Also, the visit did include a check on taps etc and free repairs to any found to be leaking. Presumably the scam in Bromley is copying these valid visits.

Obviously it's good to double check any visit is valid but thought you'd like to know there have been genuine visits recently in our area.
