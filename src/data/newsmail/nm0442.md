From today, 19th March, there will be road works at the junction of Dartford Road and Baldwyns Park until Friday.

Traffic lights will be in operation and there will be delays in both directions, especially during peak times.

This is part of a traffic safety improvement scheme CBCRA have been campaigning for for some time.
