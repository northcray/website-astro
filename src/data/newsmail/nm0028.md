ADVICE FROM LOCAL POLICE TEAM

Police recently seized 'Signal Jamming Fobs' from prolific 'theft from motor vehicle' offenders. Similar to electronic garage door openers, these devices have been proven to jam the locking signal from the key fobs to the vehicle.

Officers tested these devices on Police vehicles and they prevented the doors from locking.

Please be aware that a potential thief using one of these devices can prevent your vehicle from locking.

Please ensure that vehicles doors are locked by checking door handles when leaving the vehicle unattended, whether it be outside your house or in a multi storey car park.
