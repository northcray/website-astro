(1) Suspicious Motor Cyclists.

Thanks to Charles Bint for the following report which has ben passed to the Police Safer Neighbourhood Team.

I saw 2 young men sitting on a motorcycle parked up on the pavement in The Spinney. I can't be certain whether they saw me, although I believe it likely that they did, but they got on the bike and drove off. This was at 03.10 in the morning. One of them was checking out his phone at the time.

Sadly I couldn't get a registration number, but with the recent issues re motorcycle crimes, and burglaries I felt this might be of interest to our local Neighbourhood Police team. The motorcycle was of the 'twist & go scooter' variety.

Charles did not have the contact details for the Safer Neighbourhood team to hand and asked us to pass this on. Please see Neighbourhood Watch Update below for advice on the action to take in respect of possible motorcycle offenders.
