More Bin Issues

Two members have commented on this subject

Firstly :

Two of my bins disappeared on Monday along with the garden waste and recyclable,s.

My homemade plastics bin and the council supplied paper/glass bin.

and from another member :

The thieves will drive past houses that have had their rubbish collected knowing if they steal the bin it will be empty.

If any member sees a van being used in a suspicious manner and can get the registration number without putting themselves at risk, or if they have any CCTV footage, please contact the local Police SNT team by email:
