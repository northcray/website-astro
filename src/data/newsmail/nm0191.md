Crime Updates Available Direct From The Cray Meadows SNT

Thanks to Pauline Cimen of our local SNT (Safer Neighbourhoods Police Team) who has invited members of the NCRA to sign up for the Crime Updates that she currently emails direct to everyone who would like to receive them.

Pauline assures us that she would be the only person who would hold signatories' details on her database, and these details would not go to anyone else. Everyone whose details are held on this database would then be sent an update whenever any crime etc. takes place in their area.

If you would like to take advantage of this service, please email Pauline at:

[craymeadows.snt@met.police.uk](mailto:craymeadows.snt@met.police.uk) and provide her with your name, address, telephone number and - most importantly - your email address.

Those members who are also members of a Neighbourhood Watch, if one has been set up for their Road, may prefer to sign up for this Crime Updates service via their local NW Co-ordinator, or may already have done so.
