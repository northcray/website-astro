Further to our NewsMail sent on 16th March we are now able to give further details on the upcoming BOATE events.

Steve from BOATE writes :

Just a quick reminder that we have our April Quiz Night this coming Wednesday 5th April starting at 8.00pm. If you haven't booked yet I am sure we will be able to squeeze you in.

Also, our new entertainment evening BINGO, is on Monday 15th May starting at 8.00pm. The pub are taking bookings now and please don't forget to say if you are having a meal.

Finally, The White Cross are sponsoring another charity event in April - Horse Racing. This will be in aid of a Bowel Cancer UK and is being presented on Monday 10th April.

Please contact the pub directly to book for any of these events by phone on 020 8300 2590 or call in and talk to the bar staff.

I look forward to seeing you soon.
