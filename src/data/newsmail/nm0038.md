To NCRA Members :

If you were unable to attend BOATE's first Quiz Night at the White Cross on 6th April 'you missed an excellent evening' according to many of the 70+ people that attended.

There were 14 teams and everyone had fun with the questions. BOATE's next Quiz is on 4th May and bookings are coming in fast so if you want to be involved please call the White Cross and book your table.

BOATE were asked to publish the final scores and these can be found on their web site in the [News](http://www.boate.org/news.htm) section plus details of the next Quiz Night.
