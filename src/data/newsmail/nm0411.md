1. Always lock it.

2. Close windows and the sun roof to prevent ‘fishing’.

3. Secure your number plates with tamper-resistant screws .

4. Fit locking, anti-tamper wheel nuts to secure alloy wheels .

5. Secure anything that’s on the outside of your vehicle

6. Take it with you or hide it .

7. Hide electrical items and leave no clues .

8. Take your documents with you .

9. Park in well-lit and busier areas .
