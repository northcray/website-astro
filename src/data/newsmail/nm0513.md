Bexley launch a 'Neater Neighbourhoods' Scheme

Thanks to Dana Wiffen for sending us the following notices :

Bexley Council are looking to see untidy gardens sorted across the borough.

The Neater Neighbourhoods team are requesting that if you have any homes in your area that have gardens full of rubbish, old furniture or that are just overgrown if you could report it to them and they will pursue it further.

Often it can be because there is a reason for the overgrown garden such as an elderly person who is unable to cut hedges and grass and the Neater Team will arrange for a local voluntary group such as Evergreen to help.

Residents who refuse to clean up can face enforcement action though.

If you like the idea of this scheme and have an address you would like to highlight please email either Sarah Jones or Andrew Johnson at:-
