We have received the following message from Bexley Neighbourhood Watch :

The Bexley Voluntary Service Council (BVSC) is hosting a Volunteer Fair this Tuesday (20th September), 11am-1pm. It will feature a number of local organisations reaching out for new volunteers in the Borough to join them.

This event will take place 11am-1pm at:

If you or family or friends you know are looking for work and in the meantime would be interested in keeping the CV active; or gaining some skills while looking for employment; or simply have spare time for some rewarding work in between current commitments, please come along to find out how you can help!
