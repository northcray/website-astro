Cygnet in distress

Thanks to Julie who sent the following messages :

Hi just been over meadows 19.15 tonight one of the cygnets got a fishing line either wrapped around is neck or in his mouth .

Then this morning - a follow up to our enquiry to sse if it had been reported :

Hi yes my husband Ray reported it last night but RSPCA is unable to come out till today .

NCRA Committee members have also contacted the RSPCA today and have been told that they need an up todate report on the cygnet's condition.

Would any member who is able to visit the meadows today please look out for signs of a cygnet with fishing line attached and telephone the RSPCA.

The local contact number is : 01322 286720.
