| The team attended a street briefing last week for roads around the Royal Road part of the ward which was well attended by the local residents. The team handed out crime prevention advice and informed the residents of any crime that had taken place in those roads. Questions were also put to the team by the residents which were answered. The team were thanked for taking time to conduct these street briefings which they thought were well worth attending. We arrange these street briefings so you can have your say so please do your utmost to attend if you can. You can stay for as long as you like so even if you only have 10 mins or so it is still worth attending. |
| The next street briefing will be taking place on 20th April at 1730 hours in Maylands Drive / junction with St Andrews Road. If you would like to attend this street briefing please feel free to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
