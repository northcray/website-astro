To NCRA Members :

Door To Door Alert

We thank the Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association for the following alert :

BBNWA have had several reports of a group going door to door in Shearwood Crescent, Crayford & surrounding areas.

They are selling ceramic kitchen knives and also, quite possibly part of the same group, knocking to gain information about vans in the street (such as whether they are currently used for work) - explaining that they have an interest in buying them.

All members of the group are reported as being male and with Irish accents. They have been seen in a grey Vauxhall Astra that has one of the back passenger window's broken and covered with a black plastic sheet.

If you have been approached, please let BBNWA know. If you are approached, please give them as little information as possible and likewise, please inform BBNWA on 020 8284 5537
