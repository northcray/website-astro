Aggressive dogs & owners

Thanks to BBNWA Office for sending the following Hound Watch message :

We have been informed of two incidents of aggressive dogs and unpleasant owners this week in Footscray Meadows both taking place in the Stables car park (Rectory Road). In one incident an owner spat in the face or another and pushed her. The police investigated the assault and traced the owner by her vehicle registration plate. The matter has now been settled.

If you experience anything similar you should report it to the police, making a note of the description of owner, dog and vehicle. Also report it to us.
