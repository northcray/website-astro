According to a Campaign to Protect Rural England newsletter, March has already seen the release of two major consultations: one for a revised planning policy, and one for a brand new post-Brexit agricultural policy. The upcoming revised planning policy may have the potential for a significant impact on our locality.

More information including a video presentation is available on the CPRE Website. There is also a link to enable interested members to sign up for regular CPRE update newsletters.
