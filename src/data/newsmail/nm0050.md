Fireworks

Thanks to Paul at the Sidcup Community Group (SCG) who sent us an email relating how many of us wrote in support of SCG's views on the misuse of fireworks last year.

He went on to say that Bonfire 'Night' was transformed into Bonfire 'Month' by selfish individuals who caused prolonged distress to both pets and wildlife by discharging their fireworks on many nights either side of Bonfire Night, followed again by more at New Year.

He draws our attention to the [action](http://www.rspca.org.uk/utilities/aboutus/news/details/-/articleName/2016_05_16_Fireworks_Fright#) organised by RSPCA.
