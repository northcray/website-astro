Attempted Burglary

NCRA has received the following message from a member in The Grove :

I would like to report an attempted burglary.

I arrived home around 7.30pm and then popped back out. Whilst reversing my car down the drive I noticed the garage door was slightly ajar. On closer inspection I noticed it was displaced and a bow at the top of the door which appears to be where the burglars attempted to prise the garage door open.

Fortunately I had chained the arms from the inside which meant they were unable to open the garage door and thus unable to gain entry.
