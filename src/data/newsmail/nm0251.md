Motorbikes in the meadow

Thanks to Leigh for this report :

Further to current investigation into fishing and badly behaved dogs in the meadows I would like to mention the motorbikers in the meadows also. A gang were riding motorbikes in the meadow again yesterday afternoon.

This is extremely dangerous for children as well as dogs and wildlife. Also the noise these bikes make is obnoxiously loud. I wonder if anyone knows what the laws and byelaws are around this activity.

I would really like to see some signage in the meadows listing the legalities and dangers.
