HMRC Scam

Thanks to Brenda Hansford for sending the following message :

I have just received an email from HMRC Revenue and Customs saying that I have unclaimed tax refund from the year 2016.

Having checked with HMRC, this is a SPAM, they do not send emails of this kind. You may like to notify the Residents of this new scam as there seem to be several at the moment.

Should anyone receive an email of this kind delete at once.
