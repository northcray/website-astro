(2) Sidcup Post Office

Thanks to Sidcup Community Group for the following information :

The Post Office have confirmed that they are closing their Sidcup High Street branch on June 28.

Their decision to close the branch results from the resignation of branch's postmaster and the landlord's decision not to let the building to the Post Office after that date.
