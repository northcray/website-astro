New Fences Around The Meadows - Bexley's Response

Thanks to Jean Gammons for forwarding the following reply from Bexley re. Daniel Chadwick's report of motorcyclists riding througn a gap in the new fence around the meadows. See [NewsMail](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/newsmail_files//nm0638.html) dated 2/12/2018:

Dear Jean,

I not familiar with the current motorcycle tearaways causing a nuisance in The Meadows. However, it is planned to add a bar across the left hand side of the entrance in from The Grove to at least restrict bikers turning in that way. The actual entryway obviously has to remain as is to allow mobility scooters, wheelchairs and bicycles to pass through.

Kind regards,

Patrick English
