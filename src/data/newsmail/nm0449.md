Lost Wheelie Bin

We have received a request for help from Ann in The Spinney :

I have come home today to find that my brown wheelie bin has disappeared. Has anyone else lost theirs or has anyone got mine by mistake please - Ann - 44 the spinney

Can anyone help Ann locate her wheelie bin?

If you can help, please contact Ann direct or if this is not possible, email the Committee and we will pass your mesage on.
