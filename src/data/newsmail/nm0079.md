Since Saturday a few of us have seen this cat for the first time and are wondering if anyone was missing a cat. It is friendly and has distinctive markings.

If you are missing a cat and think that the one above could be yours, please email [The Committee](mailto:committee@northcrayresidents.org.uk)

with a telephone number and we will pass your details on to Julie.
