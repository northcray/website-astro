PLACES TO VISIT - Part 1 - Weald and Downland Museum

This museum, near Singleton in Sussex, is a wonderful place to visit, containing as it does many rescued rural buildings, rebuilt in a beautiful landscape, which tell the stories of the people who lived and worked in them over 1,000 years.

Amongst these rescued buildings is our very own[North Cray House](http://www.wealddown.co.uk/buildings/north-cray/), a medieval hall house dating from c1400. Formerly a grocers shop named Woodbine in the heart of our Village, it was rescued after its demolition in 1967 to make way for the dual carriageway.

The Museum's site is spread over 40 acres, with more than 50 historic buildings to explore from a replica Anglo-Saxon hall house to an Edwardian tin tabernacle church. There is a regular programme of demonstrations, including milling in its 17th century watermill, cooking in its Tudor kitchen, blacksmithing in its Victorian smithy, plus seasonal demonstrations. Take a walk in the woods, bring the dog (the museum is dog friendly), and visit its waterside cafe or enjoy your own picnic.
