Crayford Fun Day - This Saturday

Thanks to Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association, for the following message from Andrew Davis :

This year's Crayford Fun Day organised by the Crayford Rotary Club takes place this Saturday, 16th June 2018 at the Waterside Gardens in Crayford, 10am - 3pm.

There will be plenty of outdoor events and stalls for all the family including the annual duck race featuring hundreds of plastic ducks floating along the River Cray.

We will have a stand there too so please say hello if you're there!
