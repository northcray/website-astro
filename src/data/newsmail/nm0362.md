| On Friday 5th January the team had been advised by a member of the public that there had been a motor bike dumped in Foots Cray Meadows. The team ventured out and waded their way through the mud and located the bike. Further checks were made and the bike had been reported as stolen. The team then had to push the bike through the dense mud out of the Meadows onto the Grove where the owner was located who then picked his vehicle up. Well done to the resident who contacted us. |
