| The team have been doing some great work around a vulnerable resident. <br>Youths have been targeting his home address by banging and kicking his front door late at night into the early hours of the morning. They have also been throwing stones at his property. <br>Due to his disability he has found it very difficult reporting this via the telephone. <br>The team picked this up and have worked in partnership with housing and also Bexley Community Safety Team regarding this resident. <br>Special schemes have been put on the property and Bexley Council are going to install a CCTV camera near to his property which will mean any youths causing ASB around the property will be caught on camera and hopefully identified by the team. <br>The team visited the resident and informed him what actions had been taken which left him feeling less anxious and safer in his home. |
