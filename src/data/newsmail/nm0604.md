Motorbikes on the Meadows

Thanks to Gail Moon for the following message received today :

Following on from your earlier message, we were walking our dog over five arches today at about 4.45pm when five motorbikes came tearing across the fields from the direction of the North Cray Road.

We were at the main bridge and had to hold onto our dog as they were going quite fast and doing wheelies. They made no effort to slow down as they approached us and we felt fortunate that we had actually crossed the bridge by the time they reached us. They then went across the bridge and up the path towards Albany Park.

Again we have copied this NewsMail to our local SNT Police Team.
