Bingo Night - cancelled

BOATE regret that they have had to cancel the Bingo Night tonight ( Monday 26th February) because there are only 16 people booked in for the evening. They need a minimum of 30 in order to be able to pay out the prizes.

The good news is that they have rescheduled the evening for Monday 26th March instead and hope you can come along.
