New Local Licensing Scheme

Thanks to Annie Jordan at Housing Standards, London Borough of Bexley for sending the following notice :

The London Borough of Bexley is planning a new local licensing scheme designed to support tenants, landlords and residents.

The licensing options planned for Bexley would take the form of an 'additional' licensing scheme for smaller HMOs as well as possible 'selective' licensing of privately rented accommodation in a defined area.

Your feedback would be invaluable, please could you complete our online survey at [www.bexley.gov.uk/rentitrightconsultation](http://www.bexley.gov.uk/rentitrightconsultation) by 24 January 2017.
