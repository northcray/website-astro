A Connected Community event for the Macmillan Cancer Support Coffee Morning . Friday 27th September 2019, 10am onwards..

Dear All,

On behalf of the 1st North Cray Scout Group, the North Cray Residents Association and the North Cray & District Royal British Legion, we would like to invite you all to participate in the Macmillan Coffee Morning at the Geoffrey Hall (Scouts Hall) in Leafield Lane on Friday 27th September from 10am onwards.

There are few amongst us who hasn't had family or close friends affected by cancer and the Macmillan team offer wonderful care, information and support to those affected. Let us, as North Cray, do our bit to show our support as a Community. We will supply tea and coffee and some cakes and encourage you all to bring or bake cakes or biscuits so that we can help raise some money and donations.

Interestingly, the founder, Douglas Macmillan, lived in Knoll Road Sidcup from 1924 until 1966 and in October 2010, the Bexley Civic Society unveiled a plaque at his house.

We hope to see as many as you all on Friday 27th Sep !

Your North Cray Village
