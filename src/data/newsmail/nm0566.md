HISTORY WALK AROUND NORTH CRAY

Thanks to a suggestion made by David Jones, our new Committee member, local historian, Malcolm Barr-Hamilton, has kindly agreed to lead a History Walk around North Cray and to tell us about its history. Malcolm is the author of several books on local history and is also one of our much-valued team of Volunteers - looking after Parsonage Lane, Cocksure Land and Bunkers Hill.

The Walk is planned for 14 October, starting from the White Cross at 3pm.

Numbers will need to be limited to about 20 people - and so, if you are interested in joining the Walk, perhaps you could let The Committee know via the 'Contact NCRA' link below, and also say how many people would be in your party.
