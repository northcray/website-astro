| Modern cars with keyless entry are now a target for thieves. Some using gadgets that can read the signal from inside your house and then be transmitted to another device to make the car think that you have the key. Consider the old school way of a steering lock. A physical barrier to prevent theft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
