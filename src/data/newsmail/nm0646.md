(3) Crime prevention advice from Sidcup Ward PoliceSNT

Sidcup ward is outside of our area so I will not give the full lengthy crime report.

Suffice it to say there has been two burglaries reported this past week. One occurred in Kimberley Drive and one in Clarence Crescent.

What is of note is that both houses were left in darkness which PCSO Steve Graves says :

highlights the point of making sure your homes look occupied when you're out.

There was also four thefts of and from vehicles in Sidcup and PCSO Steve Graves reminds us that :

many of these crimes can be prevented if people DO NOT leave valuables inside, as well ensure these vehicles are locked and secured properly.
