Message from a member re London Screen Archives link

Thanks to a member in Ruxley Close for sending the following message re our NewsMail with the London Screen Archives link:

I wanted to say how thrilled I was to get the link to the old film taken at summer fete and North Cray etc the film bought back many happy memories of me as a child as I am in the film as it was taken by my late father Basil Gill.

He took lots if cine films as I grew up in North Cray we donated a copy of the one in the link so pleased that people will get to see it my dad would be so proud.

My mum was also North Cray Brown owl for many years and all so ran the youth club in the old church hall.

Thank you again for the link
