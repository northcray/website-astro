(1) Counter-Terrorism Campaign

Thanks to Bexley Borough Police for the following update :

Counter Terrorist Policing has launched a four-week awareness campaign, Action Counters Terrorism (ACT), to encourage communities across the country to help the Police tackle terrorism and save lives by reporting suspicious behaviour and activity. Communities defeat terrorism and it's now more important than ever that everyone plays their part in tackling terrorism. Individual actions could save lives. If you see or hear something unusual or suspicious, trust your instincts and report it in confidence at www.gov.uk/ACT.

If it's an emergency call 999. Any piece of information could be important and it is better to be safe and report. No call or click will be ignored. What you tell the police is treated in the strictest confidence and is thoroughly researched by experienced officers before, and if, any police action is taken. For more information relating to the ACT campaign please visit [www.gov.uk/ACT](https://act.campaign.gov.uk/)
