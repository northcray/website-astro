Bexley RSPB Joydens Wood visit report, 25th January 2018

Thanks to Bexley Wildlife for sending the following report :

Four Buzzards, a Treecreeper and five Siskins in glorious sunshine were the highlights of Bexley RSPB's Joydens Wood field meeting this week.

Joydens straddles the London/Kent border and most of it is on the Dartford side. Judging by reports - or the lack of them - none of the woodland falling within Bexley seems to get much attention from bird observers, especially compared to the marshes, and that includes the relatively large Lesnes Abbey Woods, so it is good to see this habitat being looked at.
