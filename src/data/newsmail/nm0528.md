(2) Safer Neighbourhood Police Team - new email address

Following the re-organisation of the Police SNT teams as a result of the recent ward changes, NCRA received more than one email address to contact our new St Marys & St James Police SNT Team.

Thanks to Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association, who reliably informs us that the following email address is the correct one to use to contact our Police SNT Team.
