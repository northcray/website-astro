To NCRA Members :

Thanks to Bexley Safer Neighbourhood Board who have brought the following to our attention :

The Correct Site For Blue Parking Badge Applications.

If you need to apply for a Blue Badge, please be aware that they are available from the government website [http://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge](http://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge) or by contacting Bexley Council on 020 8303 7777.

The application process is free but the cost of a Blue Badge itself is £10 (refundable if the application is unsuccessful).

It is not necessary to use the parkingpermitsonline.org website which is charging £49 for each Blue Badge application and is in no way associated with or endorsed by the Blue Badge Improvement Services (BBIS) or the London Borough of Bexley.
