Updating Membership Details

We now have 283 members on the NewsMail circulation list.

From time to time as members move away and new members join, or when a member needs to change their email address, it is not always easy to know which old email address needs to be deleted.

It is really helpful if I have a name and house address to check against.

I have the necessary details for most members, but if you have received this email, it is because I only have your email address.

If you would be kind enough to reply to this NewsMail giving your name, house number and road name I will be able to update your details.

Many thanks,

Nik Carter
