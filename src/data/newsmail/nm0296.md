Door Knocking - Knoll Road Sidcup

Thanks to Police SNT Team, PCSO Pauline Cimen for the following alert :

We have had a report from a local resident in Knoll Road that there have been people knocking on local doors. There was also a report of someone that looked homeless knocking on doors.

Please be extra vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour to police. If it doesn't feel right, quite often it isn't.

If you reside in Knoll Road or near to, can you please make your neighbours aware.
