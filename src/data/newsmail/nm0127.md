Remembrance Sunday - 13th November 2016

Thanks to PC 427 Lorraine Pinkerton for the following :

Please can I politely remind you all that this Sunday is Remembrance Sunday and as such there will be various road closures across the borough to allow for services to take place.

With regards to Cray Meadows, there will be road closures in place from approximately 10:30am until approximately 11:45hrs, the roads affected are Rectory Lane j/w Bexley Lane and Rectory Lane j/w Sidcup Hill/Foots Cray High Street. During this time there will not be access to vehicular traffic on Rectory Lane, this will include access onto Baugh Road.

I appreciate that this may cause inconvenience to some of you, however I would ask for your co-operation in this regard.

For information if you would like to join the service, the procession will be congregating at All Saints Church at approximately 10:25hrs.

Your assistance in this regard is greatly appreciated.
