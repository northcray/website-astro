Thanks to PCSO Steve Graves for alerting us to the theft of number plates that has occurred twice in the Morrisons Car Park in Sidcup. He advises that you can buy anti theft number plate screws for your vehicles which are not particular expensive.

(3) Neighbourhood Watch News

(a.) A NW member reports :

I have received an email supposedly from the DVLA saying I had a a car tax refund due to me and that I should complete an attached form which had the official logo on. They clearly wanted my bank details and asked for security questions . The DVLA confirm this is a scam.

(b.) Thanks to PCSO Pauline Cimen who reports that there was a residential Burglary on 29/5/2017 in Cray Road Sidcup between 1200 hrs and 1315 hrs. Entry was gained via a side gate and then through an open back door. A Laptop was taken.
