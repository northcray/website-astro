| HORSE WATCH - APPEAL <br>From Dana Wiffen, Horse Watch Member <br>Just to report that there has been a recent death of a horse due to it eating grass cuttings. Can we ask that if you live near to fields where there are horses, that you do not put your lawn grass cuttings into the fields. Horses will eat them, although they can cause digestive problems as lawn grass is richer than field grass, and additionally if the lawns have been treated with weed killer, moss killer or fertiliser, then this grass can actually kill them, as in this case. %br% |
