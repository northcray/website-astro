(2) Scam Alert

Thanks to Ken Dwan for the following alert :

Thought your members might like to know of the email I received over the weekend. Apparently it was from DVLA stating that they were trying to refund an over payment of road tax and could I confirm my bank details. I rang DVLA today who confirmed it was a scam and to delete the email.
