| Street Briefings - The team will be aiming to undertake street briefings in every road on the ward. Letters with details will be put through the door by hand which will inform you of the time and where in that road the team will be. This is a great opportunity for you to meet your local team and discuss any issues you may want to discuss with the team. We will also be handing out crime prevention advice and also update you on any crime figures in that area. The last street briefing we undertook was in Wren Road where over 80 residents turned out. It's a great opportunity for you to have your say and meet your local team. |
