Message from the Secretary: Irene and Geoff Waldmeyer

Sadly, Irene and Geoff Waldmeyer have decided that, for health reasons, they will have to resign from our Committee.

Both have served our Association well for nine years. Geoff as our Treasurer, and Irene as our Membership Co-ordinator, who also undertook the task of sorting our Newsletter etc. into the different roads and then taking each consignment to that road's Volunteer for delivery to every member.

Those members who have attended our AGM over the past nine years will remember Irene and Geoff hosting our Hospitality table at St James Church, giving a warm welcome to members and visitors as they arrived. They have kindly said that they will continue to support us in this way.

I know that our members will join me in wishing them both all the very best for the future.

Jean Gammons
