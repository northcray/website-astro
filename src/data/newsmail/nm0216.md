South Eastern Train Service - Further Update

Thanks to our MP, James Brokenshire, who has released a clarification with regard to the impact of the upcoming general election on the consultation which could lead to train services from our region being reduced.

The News Shopper online petition has closed but the consultation on the new Southeastern train franchise is still ongoing, but closes for submission on 23 May 2017.

It is important that as many local residents as possible respond to the consultation to make their views clear and in particular if they are willing to see a reduction in the choice of London destinations available from local stations supposedly to improve reliability.

The Transport Secretary has assured James Brokenshire that any change will only be made if there was public support for it.
