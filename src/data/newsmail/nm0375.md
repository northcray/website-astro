Parsonage Lane Closed

Thanks to Jean Carne for letting us know that Parsonage Lane has again been closed to traffic without warning.

NCRA has made an approch to Bexley, at Jean Carne's suggestion, asking them to improve the signage at the bottom of Bunkers Hill to advise visitors of the alernative access route.
