Car vandalised in Gattons Way

Thanks to Kelly Hopkins of Gattons Way for the following report.

Good afternoon,

I am contacting yourselves as my car was parked up by the small green area near my house in Gattons Way when it was damaged on the left passenger side door with a sharp object!

The damage is a very visible and a very deep scratch which was done at approximately lunch time yesterday! I am having to pay out a very large amount to cover this damage and am quite distraught as this is money I do not have but most importantly very concerned as this happened in broad daylight and where it is visible that I have two child car seats in the rear back seats!

I would just like to make the surrounding residents aware and to please be vigilant if anyone seems to be suspicious to you! Hopefully this won't be a regular occurrence!

If any NCRA member in Gattons Way in the vicinity of the green has CCTV and has captured footage of the incident, would they please forward this to the local Safer Neighbourhood Team either directly or via the NCRA Committee.
