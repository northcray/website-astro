Thanks to Neighbourhood Alert for sending the following Fraud Alert :

The criminals claim they've recorded videos of the victim watching adult material by activating their webcam when they visit these websites.

What makes this scam so convincing is that the email usually includes a genuine password the victim has used for one of their online accounts. We believe criminals obtain the passwords from data breaches.
