Cat carer needed for Franco

We have received the following message from Denise Hart :

Hi I'm volunteering in an orphanage in Sri Lanka and need someone in the North Cray community who would be prepared to feed Franco, my Burmese cat, for three weeks from 19 December.

Franco has never stayed in a cattery.

Franco is very friendly and loves people and loves attention.

If any NCRA member is able to assist Denise, please contact her directly on 07917 222870
