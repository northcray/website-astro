Bexley Crime Survey 2016

Thanks to PC 427 Lorraine Pinkerton of Cray Meadows Neighbourhood Policing Team who would like to invite you to complete the Bexley Crime Survey.

This survey is about crime, anti-social behaviour and drug and alcohol misuse. The results will be critical in helping partners to review what is important to local people. By working together we can keep the Borough safe.

If you live, work or study in the London Borough of Bexley please take a few moments to complete this survey. Please feel free to pass this information onto your friends, family and neighbours.
