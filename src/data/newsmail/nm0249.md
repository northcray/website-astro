Cygnets - Update

Thanks to Tony for this update:

I have just come back from the meadows and can now say there are only two cygnets left.

Not sure how accurate this information is but a friend told me the third cygnet was removed by the RSPCA late yesterday evening.

It's amazing how many people are still letting loose dogs run around by the water edge.

And from another member :

With regards to the cygnets, whilst walking my dogs at 8am this morning, both me and my son could only see 2 swimming around with the parent's. I often tell people that their dogs aren't allowed in the lake. But get ignored.
