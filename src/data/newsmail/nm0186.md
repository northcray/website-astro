A NEW NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH FORMED IN THE GROVE

NCRA have been asked to bring to the attention of our members in The Grove the existence of this new Watch. If any members are interested in joining they should give their contact details (name(s), address, telephone number and email address) to its Co-ordinator by an email to [thegrovenhw@outlook.com](mailto:thegrovenhw@outlook.com)

Through its Watches and its street co-ordinators, the Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association (BBNWA) works closely with the Metropolitan Police and its local police teams in crime-prevention and the promotion of 'neighbourliness'. For more information (especially if our members in roads as yet without a Watch would like to follow The Grove's example and have advice on how to set one up) please telephone the BBNWA on 0208 284 5537 or visit [http://www.bexleywatch.org.uk](http://www.bexleywatch.org.uk)
