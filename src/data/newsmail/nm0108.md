Further WARNING re. Thieves in the area

Thanks to James Rust for the following update.

it is possible they were hoping to use my bicycle to move around; it might explain why they were annoyed enough to attack my car. It was all over pretty quickly, but the other bicycle was yellow and black from what I can remember; sorry I don't have more, it was very dark.

Again, if anyone in the Grove, the Spinney or other nearby road has CCTV, please check your footage for last night between 2300 and midnight in case there are any images that may help the police.

If you do have any, please either contact

craymeadows.snt@met.police.uk

or let the NCRA know and we will pass on the information.
