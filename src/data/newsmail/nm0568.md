Thanks to Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office for sending the following Burglary Update & Invitation to a 'Meet & Greet' :

From the figures we were given last week, burglary was at 8 and attempted burglary also at 8. The number of attempted break ins may be reflecting the fact the residents are making their homes more secure and this is thwarting burglars which is good news. Also alert neighbours disturbing them may also be a plus. Please be alert as we continue to try and deter these thieves. BURGLARY ALERT: Asian Gold is again being targeted in this Borough please ensure all your valuables and kept safe and if you are going to be away from your property ask your neighbour to keep an eye on home.

As you may be aware the ward boundaries which divide the borough of Bexley changed in May of this year, this has meant that the ward you live in may have changed and the Safer Neighbourhood Team which Police your area may also have changed.

The St. Mary's & St. James' Safer Neighbourhood Team & BBNWA would like to invite you to a 'Meet and Greet' at the Old Dartfordian's Community Sports Club on Thursday 18th October 2018, between 6pm to 8pm.

This will be an opportunity for the residents of the ward to meet the team who police the area they live and work in, as well as meet with a Committee Member from Bexley Neighbourhood Watch...

Hope to see you there on the day. .

Thanks to PCSO Augustine Gomes, Police SNT Team for the following message :

VEHICLE: Having your car broken into and losing your things to thieves can be very distressing. Here are a few simple steps you can take to keep your vehicle, and what's in it, safe.

1. Always lock it.

2. Close windows and the sun roof to prevent 'fishing'.

3. Secure your number plates with tamper-resistant screws.

4. Fit locking, anti-tamper wheel nuts to secure alloy wheels.

5. Secure anything that's on the outside of your vehicle

6. Take it with you or hide it.

7. Hide electrical items and leave no clues.

8. Take your documents with you.

9. Park in well-lit and busier areas.

10. Choose your car park wisely Don't leave it on display in your home .

Thieves are known to target bedrooms and lofts. Invest in a safe security fixed to a brick wall or use a bank safety deposit box to store high value items. Be discreet if wearing jewellery in public. Photograph each piece of valuable gold or jewellery, keep a written description and get a valuation from your insurance company in case it is stolen. Make sure your jewellery is property marked with a product suitable for jewellery .Visit: www.securebydesign.com for more information.

BURGLARY: Lock all external windows and doors including rear and side entrances when you go out. Review your current home security arrangements to ensure that they are adequate. For more information visit

[www.met.police.uk/crimeprevention](http://www.met.police.uk/crimeprevention)

Be aware that thieves sometimes ring the doorbell to check whether someone is in. If someone unexpected comes to your door and you are suspicious, call 999 and give details such as a description of them, their car and licence plate. They may ask for someone you don't know or offer services such as gardening as an excuse.
