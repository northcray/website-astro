Neighbourhood Watch Newsletter

Thanks to Neighbourhood Alert for sending the following message :

The new edition of Our News is out now!

In our latest issue, we profile the Neighbour of the Year Award, back for a second year, and which this time around includes a community champion award. Nominations are open now so be sure to have a ponder and see which of your neighbours you'll be putting forward.

Elsewhere we hear about an exciting new partnership with cybersecurity firm Avast who we'll shortly be launching a joint campaign with called Cyberhood Watch. We also hear about the Neighbourhood Watch summer seminar tour that took place last month as well as the inspiring story of how one Watch member helped save an animal sanctuary.

All this and more in the latest issue of [Our Watch.](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/pdf_docs/nhw_newsletter_sep_2019.pdf)

Yours sincerely,

Central Support Team, Neighbourhood Watch.
