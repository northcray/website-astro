Upcoming BOATE events

Thanks to Steve Brown for sending the following BOATE event details :

We had our first Quiz Night since our Winter Break on 7th February and I think most people agreed it was a good evening.Our next Quiz Night is on 7th March starting at 8.00 pm but before that, on Monday 26th February, we have our next Bingo Evening. It would be great if you could attend either or both events and support our cause please. These events as usual will take place at the White Cross Pub.
