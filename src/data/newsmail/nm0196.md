(2) Device in Sidcup Santander cash point.

Thanks to PCSO Cimen for alerting us to a device left in the cash point of Santander in Sidcup.

Something had been placed over the buttons to the left of the machine preventing customers from withdrawing small sums. A piece of plastic was also placed inside the opening of the machine where the money comes out and this was preventing the cash from being withdrawn fully.

PCSO Cimen offers the following advice :

Please can I make you all aware of such devices. Before you enter your card and PIN at any cash point, always make sure there are no persons loitering nearby for any length of time. Also check directly above the key pad that there are no small devices attached (such as a small camera). Check with your fingers around the money slot where the notes come out to make sure there are no devices.

If your money doesn't come out then please report it to the bank immediately. If you suspect a device is on a cash point then always call police on 999 or 101 for non-emergency
