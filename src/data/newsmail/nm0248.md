Message from NCRA Committee

The ongoing issues of uncontrolled dogs and illegal fishing in the designated Nature Reserve area of Footscray Meadows was discussed at our committee meeting on 14 June 2017.

We resolved not only to continuing to express our concerns to Bexley Council and the local police Safer Neighbourhood Team, but also to make an offer to Bexley for the NCRA to sponsor better nature reserve signage.

In this way we would hope to make the public aware that the area is a nature reserve and that no activity is allowed in that area that endangers the environment and wildlife.

We will give careful consideration to the the exact wording of the signs pending a suitable response from Bexley Council. Any suggestions from the members will be welcome.

The NCRA Committee
