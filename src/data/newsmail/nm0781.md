| This week the wad has been fairly quiet. We have had two non residential/commercial burglaries. The first happened sometime between Monday 03/06/2019 & Friday 07/06/2019 at the Bexley Football Club on Lesley Close. A padlock on the gate had been broken and a shed had been broken in to. A water pipe on the outside of the clubhouse had also been damaged but nothing was taken. |

Nothing was taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| On Sunday 05/05/2019 between 0730 hours & 1145 hours someone attempted to break in to a van parked in the car park at the Holiday Inn. Overnight on Wednesday 05/06/2019 a large amount of cash and a set of keys were stolen from a car parked on Salisbury Road. Unfortunately this happened due to the owner forgetting to lock the car.                                              |
| This week two males were arrested for being in possession of a knife which was found during the search of car stopped on North Cray Road during an operation being conducted by our colleagues and the following day officers from St Mary's team reported a male for driving without displaying the front number of his car correctly.                                                  |
| This week the team have been doing burglary and motor vehicle crime prevention patrols on the ward and have been conducting weapon sweeps around Bexley Village and Ellenborough Road. Thankfully no weapons have been found.                                                                                                                                                            |
