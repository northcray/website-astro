| BURGLARY DECREASE <br>From Dana Wiffen, Neighbourhood Watch Office <br>We are pleased to be able to report that for the 3rd week there has been a reduction in burglaries in Bexley. Reported last week, there were 14 burglaries which is a lot lower than the previous month's weekly figures. Remember though to be vigilant - report any suspicious person, vehicles and always double lock your front and back doors, not forgeting your vehicles even if parked on your drive.                                                                                                                            |
