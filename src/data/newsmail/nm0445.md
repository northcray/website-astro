THE PAVILION, FOOTS CRAY MEADOWS Planning Application

Thanks to the Planning & Conservation Committee of the BEXLEY CIVIC SOCIETY, who have alerted us to this application.

We share their concern about the impact on this Grade 2 Listed Building.

The applicant wishes to demolish the existing side extension and erect a single-storey side extension incorporating an outhouse.

The Society's concern and ours is that the proposed design is totally out of character with the Pavilion and its historic setting; it would be attached to a Listed wall and the proposed columns to the front garden elevation would detract from the appearance of the house, and it is questionable that there is any evidence that such a structure previously existed.

If you share this concern please would you email Development Management at :[developmentcontrol@bexley.gov.uk](mailto:developmentcontrol@bexley.gov.uk)quoting the reference: 18/00536/FUL
