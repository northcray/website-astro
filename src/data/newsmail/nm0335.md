Green Belt release not included in the Budget

Thanks to all those members who responded to the request made by the London Green Belt Council and the Campaign to Protect Rural England, by writing to our MP asking for action to protect the Green Belt in the autumn budget.

The good news is that after threatening to release even more Green Belt land for housing in the Budget, Philip Hammond has completely backed down, saying the Government will continue their 'strong protection of our Green Belt'.
