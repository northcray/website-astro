| Over the past 2 weeks the team have been out and about for Halloween/Fireworks. The ward did not suffer from any ASB around that time. An enjoyable time was had by most people. Please bear in mind the nights are now drawing in. When you are out and about please leave a light/lamp on for extra security and remember to lock all doors and windows and set any alarms you may have. |
