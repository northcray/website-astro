Bexley Village Delays - Update

Thanks to Bexley Council for releasing an update on the traffic delays in Bexley Village.

Two buildings required scaffolding to be erected for work to deal with emergency structural concerns with the roof, to stop serious danger to the public from loose roof slate tiles falling onto the pavement and street. Temporary traffic lights were installed to manage the traffic at the roundabout, for the safety of pedestrians and road users.

The estimated date for completion is during the week commencing Monday 8 May.
