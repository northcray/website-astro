Meadows Action Group

As so many of you are aware, there have been a number of distressing incidents on Footscray Meadows in recent years affecting our vulnerable Wildlife, as well as aggressive dogs, illegal fishing and Quad Bikes.

There is very little that our Association can do about this increasing problem; but at our AGM on 27 June we floated the idea that perhaps those of our members who frequently visit the Meadows to walk their dogs could form an informal Meadows Action Group - people who could take immediate action whenever they see an incident of this kind taking place by reporting it to those who can take action.

Two members joined straight away - Rosie and Lynne. And our hope is that others will do so too.
