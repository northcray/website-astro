London Screen Archives

Thanks to a member in Barton Road for sending the following message re our NewsMails covering the history of our association:

I love reading these articles thanks for distributing them.

To add to your archive:

The link below takes you to a video of the North Cray road being constructed and Foots Cray high-street [https://www.londonsscreenarchives.org.uk/public/details.php?id=3304&searchId=](https://www.londonsscreenarchives.org.uk/public/details.php?id=3304&searchId=)

Also if you have a PC and download Google Earth, Kent County Council have uploaded Aerial photographs from 1940, 45 and 60. (the time line is accessed via a date icon on the bottom left of the screen).

This shows lots of interesting things such as the camouflaged factory, the AA guns behind Tescos and the stately homes on the meadows.
