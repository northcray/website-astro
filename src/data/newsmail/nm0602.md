| BEXLEY TRADING STANDARDS UPDATE <br>From Julie Powell, Trading Standards <br>We have had several reports where residents have received a call from someone pretending to be a Detective, they tell the person that there is a fraud at their bank and they need their help to carry out the investigation. The person is asked to go to the bank to draw money out (usually thousands of pounds) so that the money can be checked, but are told the bank staff could be part of the fraud so not to say anything. The fraudsters tell the resident to keep the mobile phone call open whilst they go to the bank. The fraudsters then either send someone to the house to collect the money or asked to meet someone at a set time and place to hand over the money. Another story they use is to say that someone who has been arrested has the residents' credit card details or that their card has been used fraudulently, they then try to get people to reveal their card numbers. Sadly several residents have paid out to this scam as the fraudsters are so convincing and people genuinely believe that are assisting the police. Last week it was reported that an elderly resident had paid out Â£5000 to this scam and then received a call asking for assistance with another investigation telling him to go to a jewellers to buy a Rolex watch, luckily the jewellers realised it was a scam and this transaction did not take place. Generally we are seeing an increase in telephone scams with fraudsters also pretending to be from your bank, HMRC or your telephone provider. Some calls have been quite threatening where residents are told for example they owe money and if they don't pay they will get arrested. If you receive one of these calls end it immediately without providing information. We suggest you call your bank or organisation using a number known to you, not one provided by the caller. Call from another phone, or call a friend first to ensure the offenders have been disconnected from your line. If you've handed over any personal bank details to the fraudster, call your bank and cancel your cards immediately. |
