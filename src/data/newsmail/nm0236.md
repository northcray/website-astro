Update on Death of 2 Cygnets Reported Earlier

Some small good news reported by Charlie :

Following on from my earlier email, one of the remaining 4 Cygnets had been rescued from the dogs and appeared to be OK as it was swimming along with the others.

However, I've just been over to the stream again and it seems that there are now only 3 Cygnets with mum & dad, so it looks like one didn't make it.

Hopefully I'm wrong but there is clearly a dead Cygnet lying by the edge of one of the islands.
