Dear North Cray Residents

Please find attached our invitation for a special event on 20 October 2018 at our Scout Group.

Unfortunately we cannot provide parking due to the event taking place in our Grounds.

Any support in the form of contributions of cake for the celebration or donations to the Scouting Troop will be gratefully accepted and we would be particularly pleased to welcome any Young People who wish to join Scouting.

We would be grateful if you could RSVP with numbers so we can ensure there are enough refreshments for all.

We certainly hope you can make it.
