| Keep A Look Out And Report All Suspicious Persons <br>With burglaries slightly lower but still too high and vehicle crime soaring we need you to be alert and to report all suspicious activity to us. Reported nationally vehicle crime is at a total of 113,014 across London and this is echoed in our weekly reports with vehicle theft, theft from vehicles and vehicle vandalism also high. We can help our police who have been targeting violent criminals as part of Operation Sceptre. Please report everything suspicious as I did today when I spotted two suspicious people just sitting in a black Mercedes in my road. I informed my SNT of vehicle registration, date, time and place where they was parked, together with the most detailed descriptions I could safely get. Please remember to give as much information as possible without putting yourself at risk. This way we can have a positive influence in reducing crime in Bexley - it can't be done without all our Coordinators' support. |
