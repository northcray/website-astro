News From The Secretary : 139 North Cray Road

Some of you may have aleady received a letter direct from the Head of Development Management about the outline planning application for up to 67 residential units etc on the Green Belt and Heritage Land at 139 North Cray Road (planning ref 18/02656/OUTM), in which he informs us that he has resolved to refuse planning permission for the development.

This is to thank all our members who actively supported our Association in its efforts to persuade Development Management to come to this very welcome decision.
