News from the Secretary - Concrete Crushing Works at 57 North Cray Road

Further to our NewsMail of 10 July reporting the issue of a Planning Enforcement Notice in respect of the unauthorised use of this land for the deposit, crushing and processing of concrete, we are pleased to be able to further report that Planning have now issued a temporary Stop Notice that took immediate effect on 31 July and will last until 27 August 2018 when it will cease to have effect.

This means that all such activity had to cease on that date - giving much needed relief to those living close to the site who, for many months, have been so badly affected by the Noise and Dust created by these unauthorised Works.

Our thanks in achieving this further step towards a permanent resolution are due to the efforts of our sub-committee and the support given by Cllr Alan Downing.
