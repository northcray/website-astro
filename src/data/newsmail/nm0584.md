PLACES TO VISIT Part 10 - Allington Lock

Thanks to Chris Moon for sending the following article on Allington Lock. Well worth a visit and there is still time before winter sets in.

Although it is not that local, I can recommend [Allington Lock](http://www.allingtonlock.co.uk/) at Sandling, Nr Maidstone for a leisurely day out.

Allington Lock separates the tidal and non tidal sides of the River Medway approximately 2 miles north of Maidstone. See [MAP](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.295512,0.5074516,17z?hl=en)

You can park for free at the [Malta Inn](https://www.beefeater.co.uk/steak-restaurant/Kent/Malta-Inn-Maidstone.html) car park, it's a Beefeater and has outdoor seating right next to the Lock.

From here you can either take a 2.5 mile walk walk along the footpath on the bank of the Medway into Maidstone town centre or get on the Kentish Lady boat trip.

I usually walk into Maidstone the get the boat back. The boat runs hourly on Weekends and School Holidays from Easter to October and has an on board commentary of the local sites and history during the sailing and the boat has a licensed bar on board if you fancy a drink.

Their [website](http://www.kentishlady.co.uk/boat_excursions/1-hour-trips-boat.html) shows sailing times and prices as well as local attractions and interests.
