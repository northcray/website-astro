Missing Cat.

NCRA has received the following appeal for help from Olga Lavrentjeva

Her address is 16 the Grove

and her telephone number is 07878718252

.

Good morning,

Our cat Solar is missing since Sunday. It is a very friendly black cat with white paws, white breast and white little mark next to her nose.

Usually she stays in our garden or at home, but hasn't returned since Sunday.

She easily goes to people, loves playing with kids, very gentle and kind little cat! Please could you check your sheds and garages in case she could be locked in?

If you notice Solar, please give me a call, as it is much missed by the kids and the whole family.

Many thanks and Best regards,

Olga
