More Email Scams

We have been advised of two more Scam emails that are going around at the moment :

One from HMRC and advising that you are due a refund. If you could possibly be due a refund do not ring the number on the email, do not reply to the email. Contact HMRC by their website.

The other email is from 'Apple' stating that they are going to charge you for a purchase which you have not purchased. Most of the time it is 'the monthly membership charge'. Apple have confirmed that this was a scam so again do not reply to the email, or contact them back by any details they give on the email.

In addition to these, Denise Hart has informed us of a scam email claiming to be from FedEx which ask for details so they can send parcel to you. Denise advises just deleting it.
