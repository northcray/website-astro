(1) Thanks to BBNWA Office for sending the following message :

BEXLEY CRIME SURVEY

It is coming to the end of that time of year when the Bexley Community Safety Partnership (BCSP) undertakes the Bexley Crime Survey and we are trying to reach as many people as possible.

The BCSP includes the Local Authority, Police, Fire Brigade, Health, Probation and other organisations who work together to reduce problems of crime, anti-social behaviour and drug and alcohol misuse in Bexley.

To help the Partnership decide its priorities for next year, the public are invited tell us what crime and disorder issues causes them most concern in the area they live or work in, by completing the [Big Bexley Crime Survey](https://www.bexley.gov.uk/news/take-part-big-bexley-crime-survey)

Please complete the survey yourself and share widely with friends / colleagues / clients / students in the Borough who can respond too.
