25 April 2016

To NCRA Members :

On 14th April we issued a GroupMail with an early draft of our letter of Objection to the proposed housing development on garden land at the rear of 20-28 St James Way.

We have now submitted our finalised letter to Development Control and you may read this by selecting the following link :

[Finalised Letter of Objection](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/posters/bhletter2.pdf).

As we said before, even if you are not directly affected by the proposals, you may like to lend your support to your fellow members who are.

Please do this by sending your comments

By email to:[DevelopmentControl@bexley.gov.uk](mailto:DevelopmentControl@bexley.gov.uk)

or

By Post to: Mrs Helen Acton,

Environment & Wellbeing,

Civic Offices,

2 Watling Street,

Bexleyheath DA6 7AT

And by copying your letter, please, to:-

[Councillor Don Massey](mailto:donald.massey@bexley.gov.uk)

and to

[The NCRA Committee](mailto:committee@northcrayresidents.org.uk)

Although the deadline for comments is 28 April 2016, we have been assured by the case officer that submissions will be accepted after this date provided they arrive before a decision has been made.
