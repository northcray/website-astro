LONDON-WIDE MOPED CRIME

Moped crime - in particular, street robbery - is on the increase in London.

The following incident occured in Kensington & Chelsea at around 15:30hrs on Saturday, 2 September. Two victims, a 31-year-old woman and a 32-year-old man, were approached by two men on a moped in Sprimont Place, Chelsea, SW3. The suspects threatened the victims with a knife and demanded they hand over their watches. One of the suspects pointed the knife towards a baby in the pram that the couple was pushing. Fearful for their own safety and that of their child, the couple handed over their watches. The suspects then made off towards Elystan Place.

No-one was injured. In this instance the watches were the target items but mobile phones and handbags are often the target. Be sure to keep mobile phones and valuables out of view where at all possible, handbags close to you and above all, be extra aware of your surroundings.
