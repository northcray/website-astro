(1) The 492 bus route

The 492 bus route which is our only bus is at risk of being withdrawn and made shorter journey to Crayford and Dartford which is wholly unacceptable the 492 bus route is the only bus that we have and will be putting lives at risk unnecessarily as it's much safer to get on at Bluewater and get off in North Cray area rather than waiting around queuing again and could place lives at risk after cinema or late night shopping especially I winter we have until 10th September to put in out comments would everyone please join in to keep our only service which is a great route and if removed we have been treated unfairly please get your comments in to save our only bus route
