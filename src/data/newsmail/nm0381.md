(1) Appeal From Ward Panel

At the Ward Panel meeting on 18th January the subject of a motor bike often seen riding on the Meadows was raised.

This occurs usually at around 8am and it is believed that the offender might be coming from the High Beeches area (or close by) and heading towards Albany Park. Probably cutting across the Meadows as a shortcut to the station.

The Panel members asked if we could issue a NewsMail asking people to try to photograph it or get its Reg No.

If any member is able to do this without putting themselves at risk, please contact the Committee and we will assist in getting the information to our Safer Neighbourhood Team.

(2) Britain From The Air

Thanks to Jean Gammons who has drawn our attention to an interesting website giving access to aerial views from c1920.

Unfortunately there is no coverage of North Cray, but there are several views of Bexley Village and surrounds that members may find interesting.

The site can be accessed from the following link :

(3) Parkrun

Further our NewsMail on 11th January where I promised to publish the totals for and against Parkrun on the meadows, we had a total of seven votes, four in favour and three against. All seven emails were passed to the Parkrun organisers.
