South Eastern Train Service

On 27 April we reported a proposal by South Eastern trains to have all trains terminating at Cannon Street from 2019.

Following this, many of us have added our names to the petition on the [News Shopper](http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/bexley/) website.

A report by Sidcup Community Group has now reported that the consultation on the Southeastern train franchise and the proposed reduction in train services to London is on hold due to the upcoming general election.
