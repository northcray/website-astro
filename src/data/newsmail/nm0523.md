PLACES TO VISIT Part 6 - Lullingstone Country Park

This beautiful park, covering 460 acres of chalk grassland and ancient woodland, lies within the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, alongside the River Darent. Once a medieval deer park and the estate of Lullingstone Castle, the park is home to a spectacular array of trees and wildlife.

There is pay-and-display parking in the Visitors Centre, and a cafe providing hot meals, cream teas and snacks: 10am-4.30pm daily (11am-3.30pm November to March). Close by is its popular children's play area, where little ones can run wild in safety. The Discovery Trail is ideal for more adventurous children.

From the Visitors Centre it is possible to walk along the river and then go left to take the short circular track up the hillside, past the golf course, along the top beside Lower Beechen Wood and then back down to the Centre.

Alternatively, at the end of the short riverside walk, it is possible to walk forward on to [Lullingstone Castle](https://www.lullingstonecastle.co.uk/)to see its famous World Garden, and then perhaps on to[Lullingstone Roman Villa.](http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lullingstone-roman-villa/)

Before leaving the car park, think about taking a short walk to the [Hop Shop](https://hopshop.co.uk/) at Castle Farm nearby. This is also well worth a visit.

The Park is open daily (except Christmas Day), 8am until 8pm or dusk if earlier.
