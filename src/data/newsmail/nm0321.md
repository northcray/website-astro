Thanks to Sidcup Community Group for the following warning given by PCSO Steve Graves from Sidcup Safer Neighbourhood Team :

Local residents are receiving calls from the HMRC. HMRC are stating they are owed monies in taxes and threaten to take legal action. THIS IS A SCAM FOLKS!!!

Please DO NOT fall for this nonsense, please speak to your neighbours too, especially the more elderly and vulnerable folk amongst us all. ALWAYS hang up the phone and leave it for 5mins to make sure the call has been cut off. You can also report these scams to HMRC, link is below for your own benefit.
