| Today the team received a call from a resident in Wren Road. She has had a suspicious white male who was the passenger in a red Vauxhall Corsa knock at her door two days running asking for 'Kelly'. The resident has been scared by this and believes she is being targeted for a burglary. PC Paul has visited the resident and has viewed some good video footage with sound of the male at her door. We will be attempting to identify him. If you have anyone suspicious knocking on your door, please call police. |
| We will be holding a Community Contact Session on Thursday 15th March from 2-3pm at the North Cray Neighbourhood Centre in Davis Way. Your chance to come and discuss any issues with the team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
