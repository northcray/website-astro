Thanks to a member in Parsonage Lane for sending the accompanying photograph of two men who appeared to be behaving in a suspicious manner :

Ive attached the photo of the dodgy pair, unfortunately their faces can't be seen. I've let the local safer neighbourhood team know.

Whilst the two men may be perfectly innocent, members are advised to be on their guard and call the police if they see anything to cause concern.
