Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to Dana Wiffen and PCSO Pauline Cimen for the following update :

From Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office

With darker hours increasing as we go into winter its a good time to check your home security and perhaps thinking about getting some timers for indoor lights to make your home look like you are in even if you are not. Another one that puts of intruders is sensor lighting for front and back gardens. Burglaries do normally increase between now and the winter months after Christmas so let us try to make it difficult for burglars in Bexley. Just as a point figures reported to us for September were Burglaries - 37 and attempted Burglaries - 23.

Road works warning :

As you will be aware there has been road works (Gas) in Bexley Village now a while unless there is a problem the one way system seems to cope OK. I have been in contact with Councillor Alex Sawyer as I have noted that road works (water) are planned for North Cray Road from this Friday for a week. Hopefully he will ensure that one is finished before the other is started otherwise there will be more traffic chaos around Bexley Village.

Burglary On The Increase - Action Required
