(1) Consultation On Licensing Policy.

Bexley Council are considering the principles that they will apply when carrying out the authorities role under the Licensing Act 2003 which regulates the provision of 'sale of alcohol', provision of 'regulated entertainment' and provision of 'late night refreshment' in England and Wales.

There does not appear to be anything contentious in their planned ammendments to the current policies, but the opportunity exists to take part in a consultation exercise in respect of these ammendments.
