To NCRA Members :

Homes of Multiple Occupancy - update.

On the 13th May this year we reported that the NCRA had received an alarming email from a resident in Bexleyheath drawing our attention to Bexley Council allowing investors to convert private residential properties into Hostels (HMO - homes of multiple occupancy) purely for profit.

Subsequent to this there has been a [clarification](http://www.bexley.gov.uk/20187) from Bexley via their website, largely in response to the petition organised by change.org asking Bexley Council to apply for an Article 4 Directive.

There has also been a letter from our MP, James Brokenshire to a concened resident who wrote to him on this subject.

James has kindly allowed us to put this letter into today's NewsMail to provide further clarification and it can be read by selecting this[link](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/letters/brokenshire001.pdf).
