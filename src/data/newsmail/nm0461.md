Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to PCSO Pauline Cimen from Police SNT Team for the following update :

| The last week has been a very good week for the Ward as you can see below. Obviously one crime is still one too many but compared to previous weeks it's a good result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| PC Phil CLARK was out on foot patrol on 9th April and was stopped by a sales assistant who was concerned about a male seen in her shop. PC CLARK caught up with the male and took details. This male is known for drugs/shop lifting on Bexley Borough and is one of Bexleyâ€™s top nominals. Although no crime had been committed at the time, the male soon left the area once he knew police were around patrolling. Further patrols will take place in this area. |
