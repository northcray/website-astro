| An elderly lady in Sidcup Hill was scammed out of £6,000. Responding to a leaflet through her door advertising gardening services, she phoned the company to do some work. She was initially charged £20k. This was then reduced to £12k and then £8k. In the end she paid £6k for work entailing fence panels, bushes trimmed and grass laid over paving slabs. If you are having work done then please do your homework first. Check online and read reviews. Use sites such as Checkatrade.com and make enquiries with several companies. Always get written quotes before work starts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| In Blackfen and Lamorbey, suspects have been calling elderly residents pretending to be police officers claiming to be investigating fraud on their account, even quoting the name of an officer from the Blackfen ward to gain their confidence. PLEASE REMEMBER, the Police WILL NEVER call you and ask for your bank details or ask you to withdraw large sums of cash. They would NEVER send couriers around. If you receive a call from someone claiming to be a police officerâ€¦â€¦.THEY ARE NOT They are criminals after your money. If in doubt, hang up straight away. Visit your bank in person and speak directly to staff . Do the same if you a get call from someone claiming to represent your bank, HMRC, PayPal, Microsoft or any other large company you have used in the past. NEVER give bank details to strangers on the phone or by email. |
