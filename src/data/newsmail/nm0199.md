Bikes on Foots Cray Meadows

NCRA has received the following appeal from PCSO Pauline Cimen regarding youths on motorbikes racing up and down on the Meadows.

If anyone sees these youths racing around they can call the 101 number. If they manage to get near to these youths and can obtain any descriptions that would be great but only if they feel safe to do so.
