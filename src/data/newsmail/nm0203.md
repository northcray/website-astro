Bexley Village Traffic Lights

Thanks to all those members that have contacted NCRA regarding the current road delays in Bexley Village.

The information from Bexley Council is that the traffic control lights at the roundabout junction of The High Street and Bourne Road are to divert vehicles away from danger whilst a building is having roof work done.

The work is expected to take two weeks and the traffic control will be in force throughout this period
