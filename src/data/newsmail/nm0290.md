Save Bexleyheath Police Station

Thanks to Claire Tack, Secretary, Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association, for sending us the following message :

Dear Neighbourhood Watch friends,

I've just signed the petition "Bexleyheath Police Station Front Office Closure" and wanted to ask if you could add your name too. It takes seconds to do.

This campaign means a lot to me and the more support we can get behind it, the better chance we have of succeeding. You can read more and sign the petition here:[https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/bexleyheath-police-station-front-office-closure-1](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/bexleyheath-police-station-front-office-closure-1)

Thank you!

Kind regards

Claire
