Thanks to Jes Cooban from Bexley Archives for sending the Events Leaflet for 2019 and the following message:

Hello there

Please find attached our latest events leaflet. We are offering wide range of talks again this year - including looking at life of explorer Mary Kingsley who spent her youth in Bexleyheath, Bexley's Bubble Trouble & the Thames estuary - as well as a range of walks, 'Lunchtime Looks' and the ever popular free drop-in session with the North West Kent Family History Society.[](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/ba/index.html)
