James Brokenshire MP

Following the sad news earlier this week that James is unwell, several members asked if their good wishes could be passed on to him.

We did this today, and this is what we said:-

Dear James

We are all so sorry that you are unwell and just wanted you to know that our thoughts and good wishes are with you at this difficult time.

What you do to help us - particularly in our battles to save our Green Belt - is appreciated so much!

With kindest regards

Jean Gammons

Secretary
