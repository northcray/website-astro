The Footscray Meadows Cygnets

NCRA has received the following somewhat disturbing email from a member :

My Message is :

Have you heard anything about the signets on the lake at the meadows, there were originally 5 and now looks like none have survived.

Walkers on the meadows are saying that they have been killed by kids with air guns and just hoping that this is not true, if it is then something would need to be done for sure as this would be the most horrible act.

If anyone can provide any further information we will pass it on as appropriate.
