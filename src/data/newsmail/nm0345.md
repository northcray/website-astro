There may be a perfectly legitimate reason for this vehicle to be driven in this manner, but if you see this car or any other being driven in a suspicious way, please take a note of the time and place and if possible the registration number and pass it on to the local Safer Neighbourhood Team. Only take photographs if it is safe to do so.
