Extension of Deadline for Letters of Objection to the Proposed Housing Estate at 139 North Cray Road

Please note that last week we received agreement from Robert Lancaster, Head of Development Management, to extend the deadline date for the submission of letters of objection (or otherwise) to the application to build a housing estate at 139 North Cray Road to Friday 30 November.

If, therefore, you thought you had 'missed the boat' in making your submission you now have another two weeks.

Please do not miss this opportunity.

Full details of this dangerous application, its background, its implications and guidance for preparing letters objection have been added to our Autumn Newsletter which has been issued to our local representatives for distribution and should be with every household very shortly.

As we have said in our Newsletter, 'your help is both vital and invaluable'.
