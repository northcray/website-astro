Scam Alert

NCRA has received the following Scam Alert from one of our members who writes:

Please be aware of a scam message doing the rounds purporting to be from HM Inland Revenue, stating that they noticed that there has been an attempted ID theft and you should update your details by following the link.

It's being sent from 'tax-information.ac.gov.uk'.

The standard advice applies : Never open a file or click on a link in an email recived from a sender that you cannot positively identify.
