Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to a Neighbourhood Watch Member in The Grove for the following alert :

Overnight on 4th/5th November a wheelie bin was emptied and used to get over the rear fence of a property which backs onto Cray Meadows. The culprit broke into an outbuilding by smashing a window. It is unknown if anything was stolen. The Neighbourhood Watch office advise that bins are not left unsecured. Ideally, put them away in a locked area.

Thanks to PCSO Pauline Cimen from Police SNT Team for the following update :
