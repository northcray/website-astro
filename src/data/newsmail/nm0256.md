Bikes on the Meadows - Bexley's Response

Thanks to Sarah Basham for sending us the reply that she received from Patrick English, Grounds Maintenance Officer, London Borough of Bexley in response to her email asking what action Bexley can take to deter the increasing numbers of motorcyclists on the meadows.

The reply was as follows :

Thank you for your e-mail reporting the on-going motorcycle nuisance in Foots Cray Meadows.

The Council is aware of this and our contract park wardens, members of Friends of Foots Cray Meadows and myself have tried to deter motorcyclists whenever possible.

However, there is no full time staff based in The Meadows, particularly after 5pm and the bikers know this. Also, none of us have enforcement powers.

This is clearly a matter for the Police by phoning 101 or logging a report to Cray Meadows Police Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT):

I have met SNT officers several times in The Meadows, their presence deters the bikers and they are also gathering intelligence on where they live.
