Car Theft in Parsonage Lane

NCRA have been asked by our local PCSO to let residents know of a car theft that took place in Parsonage Lane between the 6th and 9th of May

The owner had left the vehicle at a friend's garage for the car to be serviced with the keys left out of sight in the car. The theft occurred after the owner had returned home and the vehicle was later found abandoned after a road traffic collision.

All residents are advised not to leave cars unlocked with the keys hidden inside or to leave car keys where they can be stolen by a casual thief.
