| OTHER NEWS - The team have learned that a suspect we interviewed & charged for two burglaries and a theft on the ward was found guilty at court this week and received 36 weeks imprisonment. While on patrol in Bexley Village last week we stopped two males sitting loitering in a footpath close to Bexley train station. Both males were stopped and searched and found to be in possession of cannabis. One of the males was dealt with by way of community resolution (warning for cannabis) as he was 18 years old and it was a first time offence according to records. The other male was 17 years old and therefore couldn't be dealt with on the street. He will be attending the police station in the near future for an interview under caution. |
| CAR CRIME CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM <br>From Dana Wiffen-Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office <br>You will have noted from the weekly report that car crime continues to be a problem in all Wards in Bexley. It is possible to prevent some of this crime by sticking to the following - check you have locked you vehicle even if it's parked in your drive, make sure all the windows are closed and remove anything from view. These all sound obvious but many still leave cars unlocked, windows open and bags, satnavs, dashcams, visible, the best rule of thumb is to not leave anything in view even loose change.                                                                                                                              |
