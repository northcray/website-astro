Message re Herbicides

Thanks to Tony Annand for the following message :

Dear NCRA,

I would just like to bring to your attention the recent use of herbicides by the council's contractor on the grass verges in High Beeches, The Grove and I believe across Bexley. As you can see from the attached photos an area of grass around the base of each tree, lamppost and other obstructions has been treated and killed.
