Street Lighting

We have had communication from some of our members regarding the reduction in street lighting cover caused by Bexley replacing the sodium street lamps with LED lamps. Our committee have approached Bexley with a request that they investigate and remedy this. We will report back when we get a reply. In the meantime, any member that feels affected by this issue should email [WorksDirect@bexley.gov.uk](mailto:worksdirect@bexley.gov.uk) in the first instance.
