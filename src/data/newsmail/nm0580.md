We are now looking forward to our next Quiz Night which was originally scheduled for 3rd October but because of technical issues (a computer power supply failure and defective mailing software) we've moved it to 10th October at the White Cross, as usual starting at 8.00pm.

Click on the poster for more details.

If you are interested in joining us for what will be a fun evening, please book with the pub directly either by phone on 020 8300 2590 or call in and talk to the bar staff. When you call, please don't forget to tell them if you're having a meal.

I look forward to welcoming you on 10th October.

Kind Regards

Steve Brown
