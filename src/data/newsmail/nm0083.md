Missing Cat Update

We have received the following message from Jeanette Judge :

Following the recent details sent in by Julie about a missing cat : we were on holiday at the time and it was obviously our Humphrey who was being looked after by neighbours in the photographs. At the time Humphrey had just returned after being missing for two days.

We have been home for a week now and sad to say Humphrey hasn't been seen since yesterday afternoon. I wonder if he has been visiting Julie again.

Many thanks for your concern.

Jeanette Judge

If anyone has seen Humphrey, please email the [NCRA Committee](mailto:committee@northcrayresidents.org.uk)

and we will pass the information on to Jeanette.
