Illegal Fishing

Thanks to a member for sending the following experience of reporting an example of illegal fishing to the Environment Agency :

Hi

My husband rang the environment agency last night (on the telephone number previously advised) regarding fishing over the meadows as there was 2 men on the bridge fishing.

He was told by them that it was not illegal and that he needed to contact the land owner i.e. Bexley Council.

So it seems that they are not interested.

Regards

We are in contact with the Police SNT and Bexley to try and get this confusion resolved and we will get back to you when this has been sorted out.
