(2) Burglary in Palm Avenue

Thanks to PCSO Pauline Cimen for the following update :

There was a burglary in Palm Avenue Sidcup on 17/05/2017 - Entry was gained via back door.

Untidy Search took place but not known at this stage if any items were taken.

Please make sure all doors/windows are locked when out and about. Do not leave keys near the front/back doors or on stairs. CCTV is a good deterent as well as an alarm.

If you see anyone acting suspiciously please call police.

Do not deal with traders that come to your door. Always use a recommended person to carry out any work that you may need doing.
