Bogus Builders

Thanks to PCSO 7249 Julia Turner from Sidcup Neighbourhood Policing Team for sending the following warning. :

There are two white males one aprox 30 years old and the other aprox. 50 years old they are driving a white transit van and looking for building/roofing work in the area.

They are using bullying and intimidating behaviour in order to get work. They are over pricing the work.

If you have work done to your property make sure you get a quote in writing before work starts.

Make sure their name and address is on the invoice. It is a good idea to always get more than one quote from different companies. If they say they have done work in your road ask which house so that you can inspect the work and speak to the neighbour to make sure they were happy with the work and price. If unsure always ask for advice.

These men will often say that you were recommended by a neighbour. They often pick on the elderly and vulnerable.

If in doubt call Trading Standards on 07716 116452

If they are being aggresive and you feel intimidated call 999
