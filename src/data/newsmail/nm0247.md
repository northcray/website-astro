Cygnets - Update

Thanks to Muriel Simmons for the following good news:

4 pm Have just come back from the Meadows and the three cygnet are swimming with Mum and Dad so well done to those who went into action and rescued them from the dogs.

Letâ€™s hope that the poor little things are allowed to grow up into the beautiful creatures we are all so lucky to live near.
