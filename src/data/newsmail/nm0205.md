South Eastern trains to terminate at Cannon Street from 2019

Thanks to a member in High Beeches for alerting us to a proposal by South Eastern trains to have all trains terminating at Cannon Street from 2019.

Our MP James Brokenshire, along with his fellow Bexley MPs are backing a petition against changes to the current services to Charing Cross and Victoria.

The petition already has 21,000 signatures, but you can add your name and read more about it on the local [News Shopper](http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/bexley/15238236.MPs_continue_to_back_train_petition_as_signatures_hit_20_000/) website.
