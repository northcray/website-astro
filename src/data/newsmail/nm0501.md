We have received the following appeal from a nearby resident :

Hi

I live on Maidstone road, sidcup and my cat has gone missing my garden backs on to the stables/fields and north Cray road. Iâ€™m desperately trying to find her as she is not well, I was told by a resident on Barton road to contact you and they advised that you send information round to all the residents in north cray. Would it be possible to post her picture? (Please see left)

Thank you for your time, my information is on the poster (above left)

Heather
