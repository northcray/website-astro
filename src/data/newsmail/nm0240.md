(2) Dogs on the Meadows

We have received a number of comments regarding dogs on the meadows following the death of a Cygnet caused by a dog attack.

Rather than keep sending individual NewsMails for each comment I have combined them into a single [PDF](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/posters/poster95.pdf) that can be read here.

I will append any further comments on this subject to this file.
