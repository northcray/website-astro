Sidcup U3A

Thanks to George Murrell, Secretary, Sidcup Community Group for sending us the following invitation:

Sidcup & District BranchAre you retired or semi retired and looking for an interesting spare time activity? If so, why not come along to the next monthly general meeting of Sidcup & District U3A which will be held at 2pm Thursday, 20th June 2019, at the New Community Church Centre, 24, Station Road, Sidcup. Visitors are welcome, admission is free and tea/coffee and biscuits are available. Instead of the customary guest speaker, this month's meeting will take the form of a 'Showcase', at which the various 'Interest Groups' within the branch will set up table top displays and photos illustrating the group's activities and will be pleased to answer questions from fellow members and visitors. A wide number of activities will be featured including such subjects as family history, book reading, ramblers groups, parks and gardens, classical music and many more.
