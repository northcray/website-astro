Watch Out For These Fake Texts About Your Ee Bill

These fake text messages purport to be from EE and claim that you haven't paid a bill.

The link in the message leads to a phishing website designed to steal your EE account login details, as well as personal & financial information.

Don't be tricked into giving a fraudster access to your personal or financial details. Never automatically click on a link or attachment in an unexpected email or text.
