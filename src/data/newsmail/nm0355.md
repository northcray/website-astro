Welcome Home David Phillips!

In the Autumn Newsletter we mentioned the part that one of our our members, David Phillips, was playing in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race.

We are pleased to be able to report that, after 30 days at sea on Leg 3 of the Race from Capetown to Fremantle as a member of the crew of Nasdaq, David has safely returned home.

It proved indeed to be an arduous and challenging voyage - and on at least one occasion David was black and blue from being swept by a large wave from one end of the boat to the other. He faced a particularly challenging moment when two large whales emerged out of the sea just feet ahead of the Nasdaq whilst he was steering the boat. With just seconds to spare before hitting them head on, David did an emergency turn - saving the whales, and Nasdaq and its crew, from disaster!

For an idea of what the voyage was like for David, and the crews of all the clippers in the Race, please select this [YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/user/clipperrtw)
