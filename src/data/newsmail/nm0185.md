Attempted Burglary in the Grove.

I wanted to report a new burglary case that happened to us last night.

Someone has tried to get to our garage by breaking the garage door. The corner of the garage door has been lifted. Nothing seems to be stolen.

The police has been reported.

Once again, we all need to be on our guard and make sure all doors, windows are kept locked when not in use, not forgetting sheds and garages.

Thanks to Olga who sent this report :
