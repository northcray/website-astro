Hound Watch.

Thanks to Claire who sent the following Neighbour Hound Watch report :

An incident occurred on Sunday 19th March in the Blackfen Road area of Sidcup.

A dog walker was asked by men travelling in a blue Toyota if he wanted to sell his Miniature Lurcher .

When he replied "no" they told him they would just steal it anyway and drove off.

The dog was not touched. Dog theft is increasing nationally.

Please make fellow dog owners aware.
