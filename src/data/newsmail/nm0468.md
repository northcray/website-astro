URGENT - SIGN PERSON NEEDED

Neighbourhood Watch are still trying to fill the important position of "Sign Person". This person will be in charge of putting up their street signs across the Borough. It only involves a few hours a week and could suit anyone who is handy and perhaps a retired window cleaner. Full training will be given. This could also suit anyone who wishes to work in a pair as well.
