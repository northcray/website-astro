Bexleyheath Police Station to remain open

Thanks to Sidcup Community Group for sending the news that Bexleyheath Police Station is going to remain open :

Following the delivery of a petiton containing a little short of 8000 signatures, London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan has abandoned his plan to close Bexleyheath Police Station.

Gareth Bacon, assembley member for Bexley, said:

A great result for the people of Bexley and the campaign at Council, Parliamentary, and London Assembly levels has paid off. I am glad the Mayor has seen the error of his original proposal and good sense has prevailed.
