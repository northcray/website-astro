| The Meet and Greet held by the team was held last Thursday at Old Dartfordians Rugby Club. We would like to thank all those who attended and a big thank you to those that signed up for either the Ward Panel or NHW. Over 50 people turned up which was a great result. We are now in a position to run our 3 monthly ward panel meetings due to those who joined up. If anyone is interested in being part of the ward panel or NHW please do make contact with the team. The Ward Panel meeting are your meetings where you will meet your local team and discuss issues that are happening on the ward. |
