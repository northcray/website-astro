Paws for Tea - Bluecross For Pets Charity

Thanks to Michael Heath from Friends of Foots Cray Meadows for sending this publicity poster for the 'Paws for Tea' in aid of the Blue Cross Charity for Pets.

This is an opportunity for dogs to pop in with their handlers to the information centre and make a small donation for a doggy treat or cup of tea. :
