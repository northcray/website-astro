Upcoming BOATE Events

Thanks to Steve Brown, BOATE's Marketing Manager for information on the last two events in BOATE's current programme :

It's nearly July already and time for us to take a break from quizzes, so it would be good to see you at our last Quiz Night on 7th June. Also, please don't forget our Bingo night on 15th May which should be a great evening.

If you've not been to BINGO before it is great fun. At £12.00 you will receive an eight page BINGO book that has potentially three games per page. Those three games can be the first person with a single line; two lines or a full house. Each of the games will pay cash prizes but the number of games and the size of the prizes depends on the number of players. For example if we have 60 players then the Jackpot prize for the last Full House (page 8) will be £45 and the single line prize for the first game will be £15.00. If we have 75 people then the Jackpot prize for the last Full House (page ) will be £60 and the single line prize for the first game will be £15 so you get your money back immediately.

I do hope you you fancy joining us for want should be a good evening and an opportunity for us to continue to raise funds for our 'Nicholas's Room' project.
