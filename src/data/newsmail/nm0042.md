To NCRA Members :

NCRA has been asked to encourage our members to take part in two exercises relevant to our community. These are :

(1) Bexley Council are asking residents to complete a short survey to let them know how we think that they are doing. This can be accessed from the following [Link](http://www.bexley.gov.uk/20108)

(2) CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England) are asking for support to protect the Greenbelt. The following link will give access to more information and a simple web form to enable you to[Write to your MP](http://takeaction.cpre.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=21&ea.campaign.id=46682&ea.tracking.id=campaigns-update-e&utm_medium=email&utm_source=engagingnetworks&utm_campaign=Tell-the-Government-to-stop-allowing-unnecessary-greenfield-development&utm_content=Reminder:+Tell+the+Government++to+stop+allowing+unnecessary+greenfield+development&ea.url.id=606893&forwarded=true).

Both of these are quick and easy to do and every response will help.
