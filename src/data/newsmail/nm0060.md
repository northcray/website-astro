PLANNING DECISION

Lesure Honeyden Road Sidcup

Erection of one x 3 bed detached bungalow with associated parking and amenity space.

Decision: Application Refused

Conditions/Reasons for Refusal:

1 The proposed additional dwelling would constitute inappropriate development within the Metropolitan Green Belt. The proposal is considered to be harmful to the openness of the Metropolitan Green Belt and the reasons for the land's inclusion within the MGB. There are no very special circumstances which could be taken into consideration. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework 2012, Policy 7.16 of the London Plan 2015, Policy ENV4 of the Unitary Development Plan (2004) and Policy CS17 of the Bexley Core Strategy 2012.

2 The proposed additional dwelling, by reason of its restricted, cramped site location, its design and its effect on the layout and appearance of the front forecourts, would be out of keeping with the character of the area, and detrimental to the street scene along Honeyden Road. As such, it would be contrary to Policies ENV39 and H3 of the Unitary Development Plan (2004) and Policy CS06 of the Bexley Core Strategy 2012
