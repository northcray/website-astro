On 17 Feb we reported a [Missing Cat](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/newsmail_files/nm0708.html)

and today we are delighted to print the following update from the cat's owner :

Hi,

Just to let you know, my cat Nellie returned home this lunchtime, exactly two weeks after she went missing, a lot thinner and a bit bashed but otherwise fine.

Thank you to everyone who checked garages and sheds etc and expressed their support.

Regards
