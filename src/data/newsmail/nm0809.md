We would be grateful if you can share with others - whether on Facebook, Twitter or other Associations. We incorporate North Cray, Joydens Wood, Wilmington, Dartford and part of Bexley.

Huge thanks to 1st North Cray Scout Group for their support (and starting this idea!) and to the Committee Officers and Executive Members who have volunteered in these essential roles.

This is a Branch for you - so please come along on the 13th August and meet us with your ideas!

We all look forward to meeting you.
