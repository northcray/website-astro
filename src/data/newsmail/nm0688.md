Thank you

We have received the following message from Mick's family:

We are very grateful for the kind support we received following Mick's death. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who came to Mick's funeral last week, and for all the messages, flowers, and charity donations that we received. Your support really is appreciated at this sad time.

Mick thoroughly enjoyed working with the NCRA committee, particularly in protecting our Green Belt as this was something he felt so strongly about. We are all very proud that his contribution helped to make a difference.

Once again, thank you.

From Eileen Doughty and family
