Further WARNING re. Thieves in the area

Thanks to Terry Gibbs for the following.

I have just read of the break in last night. My property was also broken into last night. Both sheds were broken into and some small items taken. It is the damage that is of greater concern.

I'll also call the police

If anyone in the Grove has CCTV, please check your footage for last night between 2300 and midnight in case there are any images that may help the police.

If you do have any, please either contact

craymeadows.snt@met.police.uk

or let the NCRA know and we will pass on the information.
