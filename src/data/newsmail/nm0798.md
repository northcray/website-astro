| Also this week the team have been out and about with the speed gun on Southwold Road. Our presence was definitely noticed as we didn't manage to catch a single person speeding while we were there! We will be moving about the ward in the coming weeks with the speed gun. The team also came across a Mercedes in Maddocks Close which upon further inspection was found to be on false plates and to have been involved in crime in the local area and in Essex. The vehicle was recovered to the car pound (picture attached). |
