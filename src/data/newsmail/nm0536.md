Neighbourhood Watch Update - Continued :

Further to the previous NW Update, NCRA thanks PCSO Angel Parnell for the following :

| A black motorcycle was stolen from North Cray road on 13/7 from 1030-1230. The owner was possession of the keys, so it's possible the vehicle was loaded into a van. A vehicle alarm did sound in between these hours but the owner did not go out to investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| There has been a theft of rear light cluster from a Range Rover in North Cray Road Bexley. This occurred overnight from 12-13th July. We are advising owners of range/ land rovers to park close to their property or in their garage. You can also mark the light bulb itself with a UV pen to deter theft and make it traceable if stolen.                                                                                                                                                         |
