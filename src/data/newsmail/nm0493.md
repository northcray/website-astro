(1) Travellers on the Meadows

NCRA received several emails yesterday evening from members regarding the appearance of what was believed to be traveller's caravans on Footscray Meadows.

We immediately notified our SNT Police Team and Bexley Council and received a reply that

Officers are attending the location now and dealing with it.

There was no sign today of caravans on the meadows adjacent to the North Cray Road.
