We had to cancel the planned Quiz Night on August 1st due to lack of bookings, so now we're back with our regular evenings up to December.

If you attended our June Quiz night, thanks very much for your support and we are now looking forward to our next Quiz Night on 5th September at the White Cross, as usual starting at 8.00pm.

If you are interested in joining us for what will be a "What's left of the Summer?" quiz night, please book with the pub directly either by phone on 020 8300 2590 or call in and talk to the bar staff. When you call, please don't forget to tell them if you're having a meal.

I look forward to welcoming you on 5th September.

Kind Regards

Steve Brown
