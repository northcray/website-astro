To NCRA Members :

Illegal Cray-Fish Trap

Thanks to a member who has reported finding an illegal cray-fish trap in the water at Footscray Meadows.

We have passed the information to the local Police Safer Neighbourhood Team and Bexley Grounds Maintenance who in turn have reported it to the Environment Agency Local Team.

We have been given the following advice :

If traps and or set lines with hooks are found they should be left where they are as evidence. Please phone the Environment Agency on 0800 80 70 60. They will pass the report to the local EA Team who will come down in hurry. They will then stake out the location and prosecute any offenders.
