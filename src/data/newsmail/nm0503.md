BOATE Events

Thanks to Jean Gammons for forwarding the following invitations to a Bingo Night and a Quiz Night at the White Cross :

If you attended our June Quiz night, thanks very much for your support. Traditionally, BOATE have taken a break from Quizzes and Bingo in July and August but this year we are adding two events :

Our next event is a Bingo night on 26th June at the White Cross as usual starting at 8.00pm. Please make sure, if you plan to go that you ring the pub and book in. The problem with Bingo is that if we don't get the numbers we cannot raise enough cash to pay out the prizes, so please book.

As normal, we are unable to run a Quiz night in July this year but we will run a Summer Quiz Night on the 1st August. Again we would be grateful if you would book in and in both cases tell the pub if you plan to have a meal. The number of the pub is 020 8300 2590. We are still in the process of planning the Summer Quiz Night but it is to be hoped that we can make it a themed night with a few costumes and decorations. We will provide further detail in the next few weeks.
