Footscray Lidl - proposed development.

Thanks to Chris Moon for alerting us to the proposed new mixed development at Lidl Footscray.

Full details and site plans are available at [footscray.lidl.co.uk](http://www.footscray.lidl.co.uk/)

Unfortunately the date for the Lidl Public Consultation Event has passed, but the Lidl Web Page has an online petition that gives an opportunity to support the plan.
