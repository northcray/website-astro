DATE OF AGM

Members will wish to note that the date of our 2019 Annual General Meeting has been fixed for Thursday 20 June.

As usual, refreshments will be available from 7.30pm for an 8pm start of the formal proceedings.

The venue this year will be the Geoffrey Hall in Leafield Lane.

This gives the Association an opportunity to support the 1st North Cray Scouts, whose activities play an important part in the life of North Cray and its people.
