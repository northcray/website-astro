Approx 13.00 today someone knocked at our house to ask if we had seen or heard any noise as he's van side window had been broken into and a fishing rod was taken.

Then within the same time period our visitors car number plates also stolen.

The above message and (with the member's permission) their contact details have been forwarded to our local Police Safer Neighbourhood Team.
