(1) Soil Grading Works : Stuarts 57 North Cray Road

We have just been advised by Bexley's Environmental Health Officer that residents who are suffering from the noise and dust from Stuarts' Soil Grading Works should submit a referral to the Environment Agency, who are very keen to speak to them about the problems they are experiencing.

Several members are suffering badly and have already contacted us for help in getting a resolution to this long-standing problem.

The Environment Agency's Incident Hotline is 0800 80 70 60.

If you are suffering too, please do make time soon to contact them.
