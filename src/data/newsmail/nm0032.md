Easter Trains - courtesy of the Eltham Society

With the continuing work on London Bridge, no trains will serve London Bridge or Cannon Street this weekend. Trains will still be going to Waterloo, Charing Cross and Victoria. Updated information is available on [ThameslinkProgramme.co.uk.](http://www.thameslinkprogramme.co.uk/) On Sunday. There will be no trains between Hither Green and Dartford on the Sidcup line. There are other alterations on the Southeastern network (see[www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/easter](http://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/your-journey/engineering-work/easter/)).

If travelling to the Boat Race on Easter Sunday, please note that South West Trains services between Clapham Junction and Barnes will be replaced by buses, due to engineering work. Putney Bridge and East Putney Tube stations (District Line) are a short walk to the Thames.
