The Eltham Society are holding their annual exhibition this Saturday, the 18th.

This year's exhibition "In and Around Eltham" with pictures to jog your memory is at St Mary's Community Centre in the High Street from 10.30am to 4pm.

It will be formally opened at 11am by Mark Wall who has been publishing SEnine for the last 10 years. In six weeks time he will be returning to Perth.

There will be refreshments available and St Mary's will be having an Open Day in the upstairs rooms.

Thanks to The Eltham Society Secretary, Laurie Baker, for this information.
