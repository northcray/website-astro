Car Tax Scam Email

Thanks to Simon for sending this message :

Good evening Just had a scam email tonight saying my payment for my car tax had failed and asking me to follow a link. Obviously a scam because my car tax isn't due, and it said other payments may need updating, again this is not true. Please warn residents especially the elderly that may be fooled by the vermin that is preying on people.Simon
