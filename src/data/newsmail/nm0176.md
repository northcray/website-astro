Micro Chipping And Health Check Event

Thanks to BEXLEY BOROUGH NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH ASSOCIATION for the following information :

Last April, legislation came into force which meant that all dogs had to be microchipped.

If you still need to microchip your dog, The Dogs Trust is holding a micro chipping and health check event on Tuesday 21st March between 11am-3pm at the Cray Meadows Information Centre, Sidcup.
