| As the nights start to draw in please make sure you lock all doors and windows when out and about. Leaving a light on is a good deterrent if you go out early knowing it will be dark when you return. Please also make sure your vehicles are securely locked even if they are parked on the drive.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
