Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office for the following Borough-wide Neighbourhood Watch News :

Please be alert - after some weeks with low burglary figures across the Borough, last week saw the number go up to 10. Please don't give these thieves any opportunities to break into your home or vehicle. Double-lock all doors and ensure your vehicle is locked, even if it's parked on your drive. Also, please remember to report any suspicious vehicles or persons you may see around your area. If you don't or cannot get through to the police, please let us know and we will pass on the relevant information to your DWOs. Either way, please also keep us informed.
