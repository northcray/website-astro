Massive development proposed for 45 Sidcup Hill

Thanks to Sidcup Community Group for alerting us to the following planning issue. Although not in North Cray, it could have relevance to members who shop or have need to travel to Sidcup.

Oceanic House, 45 Sidcup Hill, Sidcup

A developer is making a second attempt to build a massive housing complex at the top of Sidcup Hill - 6 stories consisting of 48 flats. This is a reduction of just 10 units compared with the original application which was rightly refused by Bexley planners on the grounds of bulk, height, design quality and traffic safety.

Furthermore, this will be a development for rich landlords as the developer has commissioned an assessment to justify no affordable housing on the basis of the 'acquisition and redevelopment costs'.

If you have recently attempted to negotiate the Cross Road/Rectory lane/Sidcup Hill junction, or travel from one end of Sidcup High Street to the other in a car or bus or indeed secure an appointment at a local doctor's surgery, please submit your comments within the next 21 days to:
