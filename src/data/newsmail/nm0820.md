An appeal for old photographs.

NCRA has received the following appeal from Yasmin at 68 St James Way :

Hello.

I would Like to know if you have any old pictures of St James Way dating from any time during the 1900s or earlier until the present day. Also if there is any pictures of St James Way prior to North Cray Road dual carriageway I would appreciate it. I need these images for my daughters year two class project about the street where you live.

Thanking you in advance for all your help.

Kind regards. Yasmin Shiraaz

If anyone can help Yasmin, please either contact her direct or email them to us via the 'Contact NCRA' link at the bottom of this message and we will pass them on.
