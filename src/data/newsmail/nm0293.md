Foots Cray - Road closure in one direction.

Over 12 months ago a vehicle struck the side of the Seven Stars Public House. In order to affect a repair it will require hoarding to protect the building. The repair is going to take longer than expected because of the age of the building and therefore the delicate construction methods that need to be employed to preserve the structure.

While works are in progress the footway at this location be closed, with pedestrians directed to cross at the zebra crossing by Five Arches and at the traffic lights with Cray Road. Hoarding is required to protect the building and the workforce which will necessitate the closure of one carriageway in the Sidcup bound direction. Traffic wishing to travel along Maidstone Road from Ruxley roundabout will be diverted via Edgington Way and Cray Road, including buses. Access to Five Arches Business Estate will still be available.

The duration of the works is expected to be 5 weeks starting on 17th September, although due to the nature of the repair it could take longer as once the temporary surface of the wall is removed it has been reassessed.
