St James Way : Proposed Housing Development by Brookworth Homes

It has been decided that the decision on the application (Ref 16/00348/FUL) to build houses on garden land behind 22-28 St James Way will be put to Bexley's Planning Committee on Thursday 6 October.

The meeting will be held in the Bexley Civic Centre, and will start at 7.30pm.

It is hoped that as many members as possible will attend.

Details of Development Control's recommendation in this case should be posted on-line a week earlier, hopefully on Wednesday 28 September.
