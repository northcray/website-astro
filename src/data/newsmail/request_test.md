Test NewsMail

The most common reason for not getting NewsMails is that your email program is marking them as Junk or Spam.

If you are unable to find NewsMails in your Spam or Junk folders or anywhere else in your email program then please send an email requesting a 'TEST NewsMail' with your name, address and email address to committee@northcrayresidents.org.uk.

You can try the link below to request a test NewsMail - it will work with most email programs.

[](mailto:committee@northcrayresidents.org.uk)

We will then send a plain email and a test NewsMail with further instructions.
