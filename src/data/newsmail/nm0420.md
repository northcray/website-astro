NeighbourHound Watch - assault

Thanks to Claire Tack - Secretary, Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association, for the following NeighbourHound Watch report :

On 19th February at approx. 9.15am an unpleasant incident took place in North Cray Meadows whereby a dog and it's owner was attacked by another dog and it's owner.

A German Shepherd was kicked and it's owner was spat upon. The owner was then assaulted by a woman who tried to jump on her back whilst verbally abusing her.

Fortunately the incident was witnessed by another dog walker. The assailant is described as white, wearing a bright orange padded coat and a blue bobble hat. She has a foreign accent but speaks good English. Her dog was walked off the lead.
