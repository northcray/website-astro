Friend -- The February 2019 edition of Our News is out now. In it we reveal the theme of this year's Neighbourhood Watch Week in June. We also report from the pre-launch of a new NW force association that will cover the West Midlands and we round up the national media coverage in recent weeks since we challenged portrayals of our members in the media.

All this and more in the latest edition of Our News.

Kindest regards,

Neighbourhood Watch Network.
