Proposed Housing Estate At 139 North Cray Road

Further to our NewsMail of 17 November informing members of the extension of the deadline for comments to 30 November 2018, we are very pleased to be able to tell you that the number of Objections submitted to Bexley's Development Management department reached 171.

As well as Objections from local people (both members and others), letters were sent in by the Bexley Civic Society, the Bromley & Bexley Liaison Group, CPRE-London (Campaign for the Protection of Rural England) and the Cold Blow Residents Association.

We take this opportunity of thanking everyone who supported the Association in this way in its efforts to have this planning application rejected.

The Committee
