2. News from Cray Meadows Ward

In recent weeks two of our police officers on Cray Meadows Team, PCs Paul Sealy and Matt Richardson, have been out patrolling and have seized 4 vehicles being driven without insurance. The vehicles were on the road when they were stopped. One of the drivers also received a cannabis warning.

When a vehicle is seized the driver receives a £300 penalty fine plus 6 points on their licence. The vehicle is taken to the car pound and will cost the owner £120 per day plus £20 storage. The vehicle is only released when the driver has insured the vehicle and produced all relevant papers to the car pound. The longer the vehicle is in the pound the more it will cost that driver.

Thanks to PCSO Pauline Cimen for this news update.
