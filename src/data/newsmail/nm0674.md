| ST MARY'S AND ST JAMES WARD From Neighbourhood Watch Member - in Manor Way <br>On Sunday 6th January at approx.10.30 hrs I saw a woman walk into my front garden and down the side of my house. I went out and challenged her asking what she was doing. She replied in an eastern European accent that she wanted to discuss what was in the skip. When I asked why she had walked past the skip and down the side of the house, she ran off and got in a waiting silver car (registration SG56 JGP). There were two men in the car. The woman was in her 30's with black hair. I have reported the incident to the police.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| STOLEN BRITISH GAS UNIFORMS / BOGUS CALLERS <br>From Julie Powell, Trading Standards <br>British Gas Uniforms have been stolen in London so people need to be vigilant. As reported in The Times on Christmas Eve, 'Britain's biggest energy supplier has warned people to watch out for visitors pretending to be staff after some of its uniforms were stolen in London. British Gas told people to verify the authenticity of anyone claiming to be from the company. 'If you're unsure, don't let them in,' it tweeted. Police in London have also urged households to be vigilant and check the ID of anyone purporting to be a British Gas worker. The company is part of Centrica, which employs more than 30,000 people in the UK and North America and reported profits of Â£1.25 billion last year.' |
| FLYERS <br>From Julie Powel, Trading Standards <br>Bexley Trading Standards are warning residents about responding to flyers which may come through your letterbox offering building / maintenance services. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because the flyers are glossy, that the businesses are reputable. There are several such providers dropping flyers in the Crook Log area in particular at the moment. Trading Standards advise that you employ businesses on recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| NUMBER PLATE THEFTS <br>From Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office <br>The theft of car number plates across the Borough appears to be at an all time high. Stolen number plates are used to evade arrest after crimes are committed ranging from driving with no tax and insurance and petrol theft from garages to burglaries and robberies. Special tamper-resistant screws can be purchased from Halfords and online which is a lot cheaper than a new set of plates and a potential knock on the door by police.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
