Motorbikes on the Meadows - further information.

Thanks to a member in The Grove for the following message received today :

Following on from both emails regarding the motorbikes on the Arches - this has been happening every day for the last 3 weeks - the time being the same just in case the Police are able to do something about it - between 5.30pm and 6pm.

However, the dark nights are here and realistically they wont be out ruining people's walks for much longer (not in the evening at least). I, for one, am petrified when they are over there and generally head off home together with my two small dogs in fear of confrontation or an accident..

Again we have copied this NewsMail to our local SNT Police Team.
