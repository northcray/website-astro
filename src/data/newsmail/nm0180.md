(1) Burglaries.

We have been advised that yesterday evening/last night three burglaries took place in lower Parsonage Lane and one in Gattons Way.

A black Audie with four people was seen in the area, but this may or not be connected. However, if you do see it and can get its Reg. No. without putting yourself at risk, let us know so that we can pass the information on.

Meanwhile, be extra careful about locking your doors and windows.

Also a member has reported that she saw two vehicles, one a white transit van on Tuesday and the other (fake)scaffolding lorry on Wednesday driving suspiciously up and down Parsonage Lane. The same drivers on both occasions.

Our member advises :

Please can people be vigilant because if they are scouting they may not use the same vehicle.

(2) Upcoming BOATE events

We have received the following from Steve at BOATE :

BOATE will be running BINGO nights at the White Cross starting on Monday 15th May. Full details will be supplied soon but please keep this evening free for our first BINGO night!
