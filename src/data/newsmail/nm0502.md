Thanks to Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office for the following message :

It's great that burglary has decreased to single figures in Bexley Borough, but please be alert there have been various robberies around the Borough. One of our committee members had his wallet taken from his inside jacket pocket on Monday around midday. This is not just a one off as there is an obvious group working in the Broadway to snatch wallets and purses, so please be extra vigilant. We suggest you zip up handbags as soon as you have put your purse away and for men to put wallets in trouser front pockets and not back pockets or jacket pockets. Let's make if difficult for these thieves who are looking for any opportunity to get your money and cards.
