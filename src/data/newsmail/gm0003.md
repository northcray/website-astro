To NCRA Members :

Suspicious behaviour

Thank you to Jake for the following warning :

On Monday late afternoon a group of young girls were knocking on doors, in The Spinney, whilst delivering leaflets for "one of their dad's gardening business"

The leaflet gives the business address as Unit 1, Hayes lane, Hayes. Jake believes that this is a false address and was intended to create the impression of a legitimate business.

When Jake opened the door, they bombarded him with repeated questions such as "Is this a big house and how many bedrooms do you have?", "Do you work?", "'Who do you live with?", etc. They also suggested that he "go and look", as if trying to get him to leave his door step with the door open.

Jake goes on to say that he has been advised by a police contact that they trying to see what houses are good targets and that if they do manage to get inside for gardening, they will steal and or charge extortionate fees, particularly to vulnerable elderly people. These tactics and the use of the same false address has been used to target homes in Bromley.

Jake has asked us to warn everyone, that no matter how innocent children look, they can do the leg work for more sinister activity.
