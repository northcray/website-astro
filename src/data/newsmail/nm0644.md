Maps Of North Cray

We are indebted to Phil Willson for kindly sending us copies of three maps of North Cray in his possession that show very clearly its development at that time.

[Map 1](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/image/pdfs/map_1_1933.pdf) is dated 1933

[Map 2](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/image/pdfs/map_2_1936.pdf) dates from 1936

[Map 3](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/image/pdfs/map_1_1933_modified.pdf) is one of 1933 bearing a stuck-on addition dating from the early post-war period. This shows the layout for the proposed Bedensfield Estate (the land, Beden's Field, had been purchased by the council in 1953 for a housing development). It also shows a planned road layout for what was to become Gattons Way.
