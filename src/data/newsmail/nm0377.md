At first view it looks technical and complicated, but in practice is very easy to set up. There is no software to download or install, just a simple 4 step configuration to your internet settings.

A copy of the alert is available on the NCRA website by following this [Link](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/fraud_alerts/fa004.pdf)
