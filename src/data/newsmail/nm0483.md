Irresponsible Dog Owner

It is with an awful sense of 'Deja Vu' that we publish the following report from a member :

I have just witnessed another irresponsible dog owner let their dog chase the baby goslings into the path of the swan at Footscray Meadows resulting in another of the goslings being killed. When the man was confronted he just shrugged his shoulders and walked off.

Please please can we ask all dog owners to keep their dogs under control around the lake to try to give the wildlife a chance of survival and with the Cygnets due soon just praying we don't have to live though another few months of reporting 'another Cygnet has been killed by a Dog'
