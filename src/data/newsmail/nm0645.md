In January 1951 meat was in such short supply that three ration books were needed to buy a pound.

In May, the Government changed the ages at which men and women should receive old age pensions: 65 and 60 instead of 70 and 65. In October it was reported that more and more people were buying television sets.

In February 1952 farmers were offered £5 an acre by the Government to plough up grassland for crops. In the same month, on 6 February, The King - George V1 - died. In May the first scheduled Comet airliner left London airport for Johannesburg with 35 passengers; and all-party support was given to the principle of equal pay for women doing the same work as men.

On 19 August the Devon resort of Lynmouth was hit by a disastrous flood, when 36 people died. The year also saw the opening of Hall Place, Bexley, as a pleasure park.

On 27 September the Association's AGM was again held at the North Cray Place Club.

Cllr Philip Nash informed the meeting that a loan of £6,300 had been raised by the Council for sewers in Beden's Field, and Honeyden and Barton Roads; and that mechanical sweeping might replace the inefficient manual sweeping of roads.
