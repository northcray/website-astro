Scheduled Sewer Pipe Work

Thanks to Patrick English from London Borough of Bexley for sending the following notice :

Dear North Cray Residents Association,

Just to let you know, The Council's Property Services have just informed me that Thames Water's sub-contractor, Cappagh Browne (Hand Excavation and Pipe Work), has scheduled sewer pipe work to commence as from Monday 7th November.

This work is necessary to improve drainage from properties in High Beeches. The contractor will access the work site in Mitchells Field, Foots Cray Meadows, near the Ellenborough Road pedestrian entrance via the vehicle access off The Grove.

At present I am not sure how long the work will be, but expect it is over several days. A fenced compound Is to be erected around the small work site. I have let the local Ward Councillors and Friends of Foots Cray Meadows know.

Best regards,

Patrick English
