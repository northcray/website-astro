Fallen Tree

Thanks to Jacky for sending this warning.

A tree has come down in the steep narrow part halfway up Bunkers Hill (off the North Cray Road) partly blocking the lane. This is highly dangerous and is likely to fall even further causing damage/injury. This was probably caused by erosion of the bank by yesterdayâ€™s heavy rain, undermining the tree roots.

Jacky has reported this to Works Direct at Bexley and asked for it to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.
