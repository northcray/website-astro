| DISABILITY SCOOTER PARKING SCAM <br>From Member of the Public <br>New scam going on in Northumberland Heath today (26th July) outside Tescos. The scammer managed to get my grandfather's bank card off of him. A man in a uniform approached my grandfather and told him that he needed a parking permit to park his mobility scooter on the forecourt of Tescos in Bexley Road and that this was a new thing only introduced on Monday. To pay for the ticket this man in uniform escorted him to the ATM and told him that is how you paid for the permit. My grandfather tried to use his card, but nothing happened and he couldn't get his card back. The man in uniform then said he was going to get his supervisor. My grandfather then went into Tescos, where he found out that there was no permit and when he got back to the machine the card had gone. Thankfully, we have managed to stop the transactions. Several had been made including one for Â£500 and a money transfer between his savings and current account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| PPI SCAM <br>From Templar Drive, Neighbourhood Watch Member <br>Phone rings and its PPI. If one decides to go ahead with the call then .... is that Mrs X? (In this case Mrs X is recently deceased and her widower answers the phone). Mr X explains that his partner recently passed away. They tell Mr X that although his spouse has passed there is some good news; her PPI has come through! Mr X offers the solicitor's details and tells the caller that it will need to go to her Estate. The caller says that they can pay Mr X direct. (this could be tempting when one is recently widowed and living on one income) Mr X is told that a courier will deliver the money in cheque, cash or bank order form whichever he would prefer. Now here is the rub .... the PPI commission needs to be paid up front. They tell Mr X that they have had difficulty getting their commission from some clients so they now require .... a topped up phone card! Mr X was not convinced and certainly not happy to receive the funds direct. He calls his bank and the probate solicitor who confirmed it was probably a scam. The caller was able to tailor their patter to whatever Mr X said and I wonder if they targeted him as a widower. Mr X blocked the scammer's number but he has received 2 similar calls. |
