(1) Crime protection (2) Crime update

(1) Thanks to Sidcup Community Group for sending us details of where you can buy fake TVs to give the impression to potential burglars that there is someone at home :-

You can buy these cheap gadgets online or failing that, Kent Police have a shop in Bluewater on the upper mall which sell them for Â£18. They also have many other crime prevention tools such as light timers, locks for bicycles, alarmed padlocks for motorbikes, window stickers, panic alarms etc.

Definitely worth a visit if you're in Bluewater, the shop is in the Thames Walk aisle which is upstairs.

(2) Neighbourhood watch have no reports of crime this week, but a member, Ian Ferguson, has just reported :

Just to Inform you that I had my number plates stolen from Frognal Avenue behind Queen Mary's hospital this morning, 23rd. Seems there's a bit of an epidemic at the moment.
