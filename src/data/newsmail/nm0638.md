New Fences Around The Meadows

Thanks to Daniel Chadwick from The Grove for the following message :

After the resident associations hard work ensuring new fences around the meadows & the grove I have just witnessed 3 helmet less motorbikes/scooters ride round the grove, up on the pavement, & straight through the gap between the new green metal fence & gate at the church path to st James & the meadows.

Unfortunately the excellent new fence has a large gap to the left side of the gate that allows these motorcycles to ride straight through.

I wonder if this problem could be passed onto the relevant authority.

Many thanks

D.Chadwick

Dan's email has been forwarded to Bexley and to our local Police SNT.
