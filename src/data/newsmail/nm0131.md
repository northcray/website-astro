Christmas Special

BOATE would like to thank everyone that has attended their quizzes so far this year and hope to welcome you to their Christmas Special on 7th December.

Why Special? - Well, they will have a Christmas theme in some of the questions; Christmassy prizes in the raffle and Christmas decorations!

This will be their last quiz for 2016 with their next scheduled for 1st February 2017.
