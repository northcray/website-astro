Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to PCSO Dennis Hobbs for the following shed security advice :

With winter fast approaching, be sure to secure your shed to avoid a nasty surprise come the Spring:

1. Check that your insurance covers the contents of your shed or outbuildings from theft.

2. Take a look at your shed and consider how you would break in. It's worth having a good padlock on the door with no exposed screws. Pay attention to hinges, as these are sometimes easily removable. If you have windows then these could be vulnerable unless they are secured with wire mesh or grills. And keep it locked at all times.

3. Alarm it - consider a battery-operated shed alarm. They look low key but they respond to movement or door contact with an extremely loud siren.

It is also important to lock, hide and mark the contents.
