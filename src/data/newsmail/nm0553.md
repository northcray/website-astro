The Listed Wall Leading To St. James Church

Thanks to an NCRA Member for the following message :

It is unfortunate to have to report that the listed wall leading to St. James church (facing North Cray road) was subject to graffiti on Saturday night. Large writing in illuminous yellow paint. We have managed to remove this after considerable effort and cost.

The matter has been reported to the police and I would be grateful if any resident that perhaps saw anything could contact the SNT team for them to feed into the crime report.

The conyact details for our local Police SNT Team are :
