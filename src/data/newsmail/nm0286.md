NeighbourHound Watch

Thanks to Claire Tack - Secretary Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association for sending us the following alert :.

Please be on the look out for this lovely dog. It has caused part of the M25 to be closed twice recently as it was seen running near it.

A team of people have been leaving food to tempt it away from the motorway. If seen please contact the police.
