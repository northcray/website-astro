QUIZ NIGHT - REMINDER

If you have not yet applied for tickets, we are having our fund raising quiz night on Monday 23rd April 2018 - 7pm at The Conservative Club in Bexleyheath Broadway. This is an opportunity for us to raise some much-needed funds and for our members to come together socially. Please call the office for tickets (or reply to this email), they are Â£8.00 per person. Teams of 8 would be preferable but not essential. Food and drink is available from the club bar.

GOOD NEWS ON BURGLARY

Burglary has decreased over the last month. The figures have come down from the 30 plus per week figures of November / December 2017 & January / February 2018 to much lower: The week up to 8th March=10; Up to 15th March=20; Up to 22nd March=9 and Up to 29th March=7. Please continue to be vigilant and to keep your properties secure.

SPONSORSHIP SCAM

I have been advised by neighbour about a boy and girl approx 12/13 years of age knocking on doors saying they are doing a sponsored run for St. Augustine's Church, Belvedere to raise money for repairs to the church. They you ask to put your details on their sponsor sheet and pay your donation upfront. The Vicar of St Augustine's is NOT aware of any such sponsored run.
