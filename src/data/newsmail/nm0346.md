Attempted theft of a Moped in Gattons Way

Thanks to Nicola Piper for the following report :

Was awoken this morning by 2 youths trying to steal my husbands moped, using an angle grinder at 5.20 am.

They arrived and left on a moped no crash helmets one wearing a black hoodie and one a grey hoodie, both white with English accents.
