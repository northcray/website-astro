FREE SOCIAL EVENT UPDATE - GOOD NEWS !

Dear NCRA Members,

We are pleased to announce that there is enough support to enable us to host our 75th NCRA Anniversary Event at the Scouts Hall in Leafield Lane on Sunday 8th September from 2pm onwards.

Thank you to those that have already responded and, if any other members & their household wish to attend, please contact the NCRA as we need to monitor attendance numbers for catering purposes.

As in our previous note, we will be providing some drinks ( wine, beer, soft drinks , tea, coffee ) but we are leaving people free to additionally bring their own beverages too, if they wish to do so.

We may also run a Barbecue but we may need a willing volunteer or two to be our Jamie Oliver or Delia Smith for part of the afternoon. Please let us know if you wish to help !

We look forward to seeing you all on Sunday 8th September !

Your NCRA Committee
