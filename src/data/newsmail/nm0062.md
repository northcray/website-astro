Sidcup Manor House

The future of Sidcup Manor House, a The Grade II listed building which has operated as the borough's registry office since 1993, is set to be decided this year. A consultation period started this month and will last until mid August.

Danson House is expected to become the borough's new register office.

The plan for the site's future is available in local libraries and [online](http://www.bexley.gov.uk/ourconsultations) where you can express your opinion.
