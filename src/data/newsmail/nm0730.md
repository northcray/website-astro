Neighbourhood Watch News

| From Neighbourhood Watch Office Chairman Dana Wiffen, <br>Thank you to the Bexley Village Trader for letting us know that there is now a Post Office in Bexley Village again, this is something that had escaped me and I have been using the Crayford one. 7 Months after its closure in what was Martins Newsagents, it has finally re-opened further along the High Street last month in Bexley Village at number 26 Bexley High Street - Costcutters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Wednesday 27/03/2019 we were involved in a joint operation with Kent Police, traffic police and South East tasking team on Maidstone Road & A20 with the intention of disrupting criminals using these routes to travel between both policing areas to commit crime. A male who had been wanted for some time was arrested and drivers were dealt with for speeding and no insurance offences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
