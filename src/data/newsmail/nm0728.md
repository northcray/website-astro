Message from a member in The Grove

My Message is :

I was sad to notice there are now only two Egyptian geese signets left

I am not surprised since most of the water fouls vegetation is gone and the small islands they nested bare.

We raised this concern last autumn when the Council first demolished them to be told they would grow back.

Sadly, we lost all our signets last year to exposure to bad weather, air rifles and dogs

This year the nest is completely exposed to everything.

It breaks my heart to see more dead carcass and another year of depleting wildlife.

Why do this and continue to do when its obvious it has such a negative affect.

Kind regards

Jane
