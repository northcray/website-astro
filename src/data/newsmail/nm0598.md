LOCAL SOCIETIES & ORGANISATIONS - Part 9 Bexley Historical Society

Founded in 1951, the [Bexley Historical Society](https://www.bexleyhistoricalsociety.co.uk/) is the longest-established of all the local history societies in the London Borough of Bexley and over the years its members have contributed their knowledge and experience to a number of published works and archaeological excavations. Through its Then and Now project it is creating a photographic record of the whole borough.

Members meet at the hall of St John Fisher RC Church, 48, Thanet Road, Bexley DA5 1AP, where they listen to speakers talking about local, general historical and archaeological subjects about the Bexley Borough and its surrounding areas. Non-members are welcome, when a fee of £3 per meeting is payable.

Membership of the Bexley Historical Society costs just £18 per year January to December. This includes free entry to its monthly talks, a regular newsletter and the opportunity to take part in its projects.
