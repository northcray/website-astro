Jean Gammons writes :

I am indebted to Bob Ogley for the story that he tells in his series of books which sets out what was going on in the World at large. Both as a valuable source of information and for the inspiration that his books have given to me in writing my series on the history of the NCRA and the evolution of North Cray from a rural community to a London suburb.
