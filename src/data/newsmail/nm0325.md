Stop Green Belt release in the Autumn Budget

Thanks to Catherine Maguire from London Green Belt Council and Crispin Truman, Chief Executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, both of whom have alerted us to the risk to the Green Belt in the Autumn Budget on 22 November.

Both organisations are asking concerned members of the public to 'take action' and write to their MP.

An easy to use online form that can be used to do this can be accessed via this [LINK](http://takeaction.cpre.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=21&ea.campaign.id=81087&ea.tracking.id=campaigns-update-enews&utm_medium=email&utm_source=engagingnetworks&utm_campaign=green-belt-action-2017&utm_content=2017+Green+Belt+action&ea.url.id=1129813&forwarded=true)
