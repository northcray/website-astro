Waste & Recycling App

Bexley are recommending a 'WASTE & RECYCLING' app written by Agile Applications.

It is compatible with mobile phones or tablets using the Android or IOS operating system.

Download from Google Play or the Apple App Store as appropriate.

Limited testing suggest that whilst It gives useful information regarding what can or cannot be re-cycled, the dates for collection may only be accurate for the weekly recycling. The date given for the next fortnightly waste collection for my adress was wrong.

Hopefully this will be a teething issue and will be corrected in future.
