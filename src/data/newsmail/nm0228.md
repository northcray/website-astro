Neighbourhood Watch - Update

(1) BOGUS PHONE CALLER

Please beware of an automated telephone call claiming to be Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs. The message tells you that you have tax owing and instructs you to press a number to be connected to your case worker. DO NOT DO IT! END THE CALL.! Bexley Borough is being targeted by this scam and has been for a few months. The message is generic and is played to anyone who receives the call. If you press the number to be connected to the case worker, you will be charged an extortionate rate per minute.

NW will be at Maplin's in Crayford and they will be offering NW members 10% discount for anything purchased on the day.
