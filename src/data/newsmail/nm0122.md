Further to our two NewsMails re. Thames Water

NCRA has received the following email from Bromley Neighbourhood Watch Association :

information now received from Bromley Trading Standards suggests we were misled and the Thames Water visits are, after all, perfectly genuine.

An unfortunate case of Thames' left hand not being aware what its right hand was doing. The company is conducting these visits and it is not a scam.

BNWA apologises for causing concern.

Thanks to Bromley Neighbourhood Watch Association for their correction.

Nevertheless it is still good advice to double check that anyone wanting to enter your home is in fact a genuine representative of the organisation that they claim to work for.
