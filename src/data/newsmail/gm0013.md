Planning Outcome: Orchard View Farm

Disappointingly, and contrary to the decision made by Bexley's Planning Committee on 14 December 2017 to refuse planning permission for three new dwellings on Green Belt & Heritage Land at Orchard View Farm, 63 Parsonage Lane, the Appeal Inspector has decided in favour of the applicant's appeal against Bexley's decision.

However, there is some comfort in that the Inspector imposed very stringent Conditions on this housing development, and our Association has asked the Head of Bexley's Development Management department to ensure that these are rigorously adhered to.
