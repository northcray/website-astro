Locals give key feedback to help shape BCSP priorities

Thanks to Danielle Fuller, Co-ordinator, Bexley Safer Neighbourhood Board for sending the following message :

Alternatively this can be reported online at[Metropolitan Police](https://www.met.police.uk/)- this officially records the incidents and can help the police when directing their resources.

This year's survey included a £50 Morrisons voucher prize draw. The voucher was awarded to a Sidcup resident, who has requested no publicity.

Kind regards,

Danielle Fuller

Burglary is the crime which concerns Bexley residents the most, while anti-social behaviour from groups of people loitering is the chief concern when it comes to ASB issues.

These are just some of the findings drawn from feedback given in the recent annual Bexley Crime Survey.

The survey, which was completed by 1,304 people, was organised by the Bexley Community Safety Partnership (BCSP) and ran between 28 September and 31 December last year.

The statutory members of the BCSP include the Council, Metropolitan Police, London Fire Brigade, Probation and Health. They are supported by other local organisations, including the voluntary sector, and work together to tackle crime, anti-social behaviour and drug and alcohol misuse.

The 3 crimes that responders (1,124) felt were a priority were:

burglary (697)

drug supply/selling (308)

vehicle crime (249)

The 3 types of anti-social behaviour that concerned people who responded (1,017) the most were:

groups of people loitering (528)

vehicle nuisance (367)

drug paraphernalia (321)

Cllr Alex Sawyer, Cabinet Member for Communities said: 'I would like to thank everyone who took time to give feedback to this very important survey.

â€œThe BCSP will use the responses, alongside other data, to help decide partnership priorities across the borough for 2019/20. It will continue to work closely with all partners to help tackle issues highlighted in the survey.'

The public are encouraged to continue to report all incidents of crime and anti-social behaviour to the police via 101 (or 999 in case of an emergency).
