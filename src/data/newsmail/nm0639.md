If you are interested in joining us we will have Christmas themed questions, Christmas decorations a Christmas raffle and, like last year, it would be fun if we could all wear our Christmas outfits. If you would like to join us for what will be a fun evening, please book with the pub directly either by phone on 020 8300 2590 or call in and talk to the bar staff. When you call, please don't forget to tell them if you're having a meal.

I look forward to welcoming you on 5th December

Kind Regards
