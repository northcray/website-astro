| This week we have recovered two stolen vehicles, a white van from Palm Avenue and a blue Focus which was found at Rebecca Court in Sidcup. We also assisted Sidcup SNT this week with a search and containment in relation to a disqualified driver who fled the scene after he crashed the BMW he was driving in Landsdowne Road. He is still outstanding unfortunately.                                                                                                           |
| In the past week we have been made aware of two suspicious vehicles to keep an eye out for. A black BMW X5 displaying CX08SXV was seen in suspicious circumstances paying close attention to vans parked in The Grove last week. When a resident tried to confront the driver the car sped off. Please note that the registration plates have been stolen from the same style of vehicle which is registered locally.                                                               |
| Also look out for a blue 63 plate Kia Sportage towing a trailer. Two males in this vehicle were seen to be trying to gain access to the rear of a house in Hill Crescent last week on the pretence of trimming hedges. The occupants of the house were not home at the time and it has been confirmed that no permission had been given for any work to be carried out. Due to the vigilance of neighbours these two males were deterred from potentially breaking in to the house. |
| PCSO Dee will be teaming up with Sidcup SNT's PCSO Steve again at Lidl, Footscray High Street on Saturday 21/09/2019 from 1100 -1300 hours where they will be holding a crime prevention event. They hope to see you there!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
