THE HEAP

Members will be delighted to know that we have just been informed by our partners, the Chislewick Residents Association, that the area of land containing the enormous pile of rubbish built-up by Waste4Fuel off Cornwall Drive has now been purchased by Bromley Council, and that this rubbish will be cleared as quickly as possible. The hope is that some 'green' use will now be made of this piece of Green Belt land.

A special thank you is due to our MP, James Brokenshire, who has worked hard over the past five years in support of his counterparts in Bromley to get this problem resolved for the residents of both Bromley and Sidcup.
