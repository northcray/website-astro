| The ward seems to have been hit with a fair amount of vehicle crime. Please ensure all vehicles are securely locked even if the vehicle is parked on the drive. Please make sure no items are left in the car that can easily be seen. Please also make sure all doors and windows are locked before you go out and set any alarms you have. |
