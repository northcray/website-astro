INLAND REVENUE PHONE SCAM

Thanks to Dana Wiffen for alerting us to the flood of complaints received by Neighbourhood Watch coming from residents targetted again this week with this precorded message that threatens legal action and is aimed at frightening residents into being conned.

We reported this on 3 March but have repeated it below as a reminder :

INLAND REVENUE PHONE SCAM

On 6th March I received a recorded message from 020 8089 1901 stating it was the Inland Revenue and there is a large law suit against me and I needed to call number urgently. I cut off!! Looked up number on the internet and there was a list of similar calls which were threatening and targeting the older generation, even saying, they would send someone round to collect monies. - Please be aware.
