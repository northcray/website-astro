| No Crime Reports this week. <br>This is an on-going initiative run by volunteers and is pretty time-intensive to collate. The crime information is not a definitive list by any means but enables trends and key issues to be identified and local residents to be alerted. Where no reports have been received, it is not necessarily that no incidents have occurred but, rest-assured, we continue to work hard to fulfil our aim of having information to share for every Ward every week. We do monitor and follow up frequently where there are persistent gaps. Amongst police SNT teams, these can occur from time to time as a result of shift patterns, rest days and workload. |
