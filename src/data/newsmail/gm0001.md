This is a planning application of serious concern to us as an Association and to those residents directly affected.

These residents will, of course, be writing to Planning themselves; but we hope very much that - even if you are not directly affected- you will lend your support to your fellow members (whose lives will be made miserable if the application is approved) by also emailing or writing to Planning:-
