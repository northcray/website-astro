Notice of Proposed Development re Manor Freehold Farm

NCRA has lodged our concerns regarding this proposed development :

Dear Mrs Acton

I am now able to send you our comments on the above application, which are contained in our attached letter.

Hopefully, you will be able to agree with us that, where people might live, any risk to human health should be regarded as unacceptable. And in this case we do see a very serious risk.

Yours sincerely

Jean Gammons

Secretary

North Cray Residents Association
