Burglary alert from a member.

Thanks to one of our members for sending the following message :

Hi can you please forward this on to all. Please can you all be vigilant as there has just been an attempted robbery at 6 this evening at 177 north cray rd. Luckily the owner was at home and was able to shout at the man. I live next door and my daughter was just about to drive off when the man jumped over the gate. He is white skinny scruffy looking wearing dark track suit bottoms blue top a green jacket carrying a large rack sack. He had short blondish hair and what looked like a tattoo on the inside of his left forearm.
