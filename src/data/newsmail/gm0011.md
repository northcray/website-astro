Planning Objection

Ref 18/00516/FUL 67 Gattons Way: Side extension, porch and garage (Revised)

NCRA does not usually comment on planning applications for house extensions unless what is being proposed is of concern to the immediate neighbours and, as members of our Association, they have sought our support.

This [application](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/letters/67_gattons_way.pdf) is such a case.
