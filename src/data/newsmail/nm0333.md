Waste 4 Fuel dump update

Thanks to Sidcup Community Group for notifying us that the apalling scandal of the Waste 4 Fuel dump in Cornwall Drive, close to the Ruxley roundabout, has now been resolved.

At a cost Â£4.5 million to the tax payer, 27,000 tons of rubbish have been removed from the site, finally putting an end to the stench and frequent oubreaks of fire. The criminals who perpetrated this scam are at liberty, reportedly in Spain.

Bromley Council are now considering what the final outcome for this site will be and are listening very carefully to what local residents say, whilst taking into account the importance of the site's Green Belt status.
