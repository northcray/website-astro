Footscray Meadows parkrun update

Thanks to Richard and the Team for sending the following message :

As promised we are writing to give you an update on the progress of bringing parkrun to the meadows.

We have finally been able to obtain the necessary funding together with permission from the council for the use of the land for the purpose of parkrun.

With this in mind we are looking for local people to get involved in both running at the event and also with building a core team of volunteers to help the event run smoothly. If you are interested in being part of the ongoing event support then please let us know.

We do not have an exact start date but as with all parkruns the event will take place at 9am every Saturday morning. Whilst we wait for a start date we will be training volunteers over at Bexley parkrun and ensuring everything is in place so that the first event goes as smooth as possible. There will also be a couple of meetings for the team to get to know each other.
