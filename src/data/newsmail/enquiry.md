Thank you for your enquiry. It will be forwarded to each member of the committee and will be dealt with if it is something that falls within our remit.

NCRA will always help residents in dealing with issues that do fall within our remit, particularly where an individual approach to a local or national authority has been met with an un-helpful response or simply ignored.

However, unless there are special circumstances we do expect members to make their own enquiries in the first instance.

To assist this we have links on our website to the majority of likely information sources :

[Bexley Council](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/council.html)

[Community Services](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/community.html)

If you are unable to find what you want, or fail to get a suitable response, then please do contact us again via the 'Committee' or 'Contact Us' link and we will then help as best we may.

Also, if you obtain any information that you feel would be useful to our members and would like to see it circulated, then please send it in.
