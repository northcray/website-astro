Motor Vehicle Vandalised In St James Way

An NCRA member reports that on the 21st October at 1:27am a grey 4 door Corsa parked in St James Way was vandalised. The passenger wing mirror was ripped from the car and stolen in full view of CCTV cameras.

Footage shows a car pulling off of the North Cray road from the direction of Bexley village and stop next to the Corsa. Its headlights were then turned off and a male was seen walking up to the Corsa, put on a pair of gloves and then force the wing mirror off of the Corsa. He then returned to his car and drove off in the direction of Ellenborough Road.

Details of the offence, including a full description of the thief/ vandal have been passed to the Police.
