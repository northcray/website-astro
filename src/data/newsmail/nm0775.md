| PC SCOTT and PC ROSE attended HMP Belmarsh on Tuesday 28th May to interview a suspect for two burglaries and a theft. Two of which were committed on our ward. Due to a lot of work by the officers and other colleagues to secure witness statements, CCTV and forensic evidence it was impossible for the suspect to deny his involvement. The file is awaiting supervision for a charging decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| From Dana Wiffen, Chairman, Neighbourhood Watch Office <br>Burglary figures have crept back up over the past 2 weeks. During this period there have been 20 burglaries and 13 attempted burglaries. <br>Blackfen & Lamorbey, Crooklog, Longlands, Sidcup, St. Mary's & St. James & Thamesmead seem to be the worst hit over this period and we continue to try and recruit new Coordinators in these wards. <br>We continue to see a rise in other crimes such as vehicle vandalism, theft from vehicles and vehicle theft. So can we ask that all members continue to be alert and report anything they see that is suspicious even if it turns out to be nothing. <br>Please remember that the police and us need to know as much information as posssible, which should include date, time, description of person(s), description of vehicle with registration number if possible and of course where seen. <br>Houndwatch members, please remember to report anything you may see while you are walking your dog(s). %br% |
