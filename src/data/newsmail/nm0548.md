Stray Dog in Parsonage Lane

Thanks to Jean Carne for the following message re the stray dog seen in Parsonage Lane on 14 August.

I know quite a few in the lane have been trying to catch it and are concerned. May be the authorities should be involved ? Haven't seen the dog today yet.

Please see link below for a face book status.
