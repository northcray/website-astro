Message from PCSO Pauline Cimen :

When you are walking your dogs on the Meadows, please be mindful of the horses on the bridle path. We are having complaints from the stables saying that dogs are running around that area without any owner in sight causing alarm to the horses. They are trying to get the council to do more signage

This echos a similar email from PC Paul Sealy.

The general message is that the meadows needs to be shared by responsible dog owners as well as the horse riders and that we should all try to keep our dogs away from the bridle path and ideally within sight at all times.
