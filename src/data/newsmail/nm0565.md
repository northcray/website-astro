Thieves are In the area

We have just received the following message from a member in High Beeches :

THIEVES are in the area .

I had a quantity of fishing equipment stolen from my locked car between 7pm and 8.30 on Thursday night in High Beeches

The THIEVES smashed a door window to gain entry and steal property.

Do not leave anything in the car.

Be warned
