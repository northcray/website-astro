News From The Secretary : Locally Listed Buildings

In November, our President John Harrington and I - in company with our colleagues on the planning & conservation committee of The Bexley Civic Society- attended a meeting with Bexley's Heritage Officer to discuss Bexley's Local List of buildings and other structures of local importance and historic value. Although these do not possess the statutory status held by those of national significance, their conservation is regarded as important. Also explored was how any additions might be made.

Currently, the Local List contains the following entries for North Cray:-.

Cocksure Lane : Little Mascal Farm and its Barn, Loose Boxes and Cow Shelter; and The White House

North Cray Road : Nos. 37 (Avenue Lodge), 104 (The Cottage), 128 (Vale Mascal), 130 & 132 (Vale Mascal Court); Home Close Farm, No. 2 Home Close Farm and Mount Mascal Farm; Nos. 146 (The White Cross), 166 (Pear Tree Cottage) and 168 & 170 (Former North Cray School and Schoolhouse); and Manor Farm

Parsonage Lane : Nos. 1 & 2 combined (The Jays) and No. 3 (Sandpit Cottage); Nos. 55, 57 and 59 (Manor Cottages) and 61 (The Bungalow)

St James Way : No. 77 and the Edward VIII Pillar Box 1936 (by the post office and shop)

Water Lane : Post box in the wall of No. 8

The Local List is actively kept under review, and residents and local amenity groups can nominate additions at any time. To see the procedure for this, follow this[Link](http://www.northcrayresidents.org.uk/pdf_docs/local_list_nominations_procedure.pdf).

To help you to know the history and status of all Listed buildings in North Cray (whether Locally Listed or Grade 11 Listed by Historic England) I have compiled a separate list - one that also includes buildings which are currently Unlisted.
