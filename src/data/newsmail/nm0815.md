The weather forecast, fingers crossed, looks good with sun expected with a high of 19 degrees.

We will be providing some refreshments with fresh platters of sandwiches, cakes, soft drinks and we have some beer, wine and prosecco. Please feel free to bring along some drinks if you want to. If anyone has any dietary requirements, please let us know.
