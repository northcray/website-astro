(2) Neighbourhood Watch Update

Thanks to a Neighbourhood Watch Member for the following warning : Just to let you know that a couple of residents have had phone calls pertaining to be from BT asking them to download a 'Team Viewer' app as their internet has been compromised. I believe it to be a scam. The Neighbourhood Watch office says never to give remote access to your computer, tablet or mobile phone to anyone who happens to telephone you claiming that you have a virus or your connection has been compromised.

Thanks to PCSO Pauline Cimen from Police SNT Team for the following update :

| On Friday 16th March at 1800 hrs Cray Meadows team conducted a street briefing in Wren Road. Over 300 letters had been delivered by hand by PC Paul Sealy inviting them to the briefing. The team were there to hand out crime prevention advice and to answer any questions the residents wanted to ask the team. Over 80 residents turned up to the street briefing which was the best turn out the team had ever had. We were there for just over an hour. One of the residents even set up a WhatsApp group with other residents which is a great way of communicating with each other. The best thing of all was bringing the community together. People talking to each other about issues they are having and a real community feel. Due to this success we will be holding the next street briefing in Bexley Lane (date to be confirmed). If you would like your local team to conduct a street briefing in your road please email the team on Craymeadows.snt@met.pnn.police.uk where we will be happy to assist. |
| Our next community contact point is on 23rd March - 1000-1100 hrs - Tudor Cafe Maidstone Road. Please come along and meet your local team where we will be able to discuss any issues you may be having.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
