NCRA has received several communications from other local organisations who are protesting about Bexley's decision to approve the building of a 13 storey housing complex in Bexleyheath.

As the development is outside of NCRA's area we are not proposing to organise a protest but are happy to report in this NewsMail that many Bexleyheath residents are up in arms over what they consider a breach of trust in the manner that Bexley's planning committee handled this application.
