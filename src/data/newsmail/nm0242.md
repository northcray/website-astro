Vehicle Online Shopping Fraud

An alert from Action Fraud describes a scam whereby fraudsters have been advertising vehicles and machinery for sale on various selling platforms online. The victims are persuaded to pay an upfront deposit to a supposedly secure escrow provider, only to find later that they have been tricked and have lost their money.

Full details of this and many other scams can be read on the [Action Fraud](https://www.actionfraudalert.co.uk/) website.
