Phone and letter scams

We have been advised of the following scams :

(1) Cold calling scam to say that the resident had to have a CO2 monitor by law and offered to sell one for Â£80.

(2) Scam call claiming to be from BT or Microsoft saying that there is a virus on the resident's computer. The intention is to get their bank details.

(3) Letter scam claiming to be from Peoples Postcode Lottery and stating that the addressee has won a substantial sum. The letter gives a telephone number to call which if rung charges a large amont of money to the callers telephone account.

Please be careful if you receive any calls or letters of this nature.
