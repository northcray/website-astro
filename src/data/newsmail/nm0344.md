Suspicious vehicle in High Beeches

Thanks to Simon Stevens for the following alert :

In the last hour a blue, I believe Mitsubishi or Japanese type four door estate with 3/4 white males in High Beeches appeared to be stopping every 100 metres having a look then driving up.

I took a picture but not good quality, index believed to be a Y Reg so old style keep your eyes out.
