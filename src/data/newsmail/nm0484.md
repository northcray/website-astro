PLACES TO VISIT Part 4 - Wealden Times Mid Summer Fair

The Wealden Times Mid Summer Fair is a firm family favourite outing or ours and we attend every year.

Whilst it is not on our doorstep, the journey to Hole Park estate near Tenterden is well worth it. There are more than 200 exhibitors each year selling a mixture of antiques, quality crafts, pet supplies, garden ornaments, food and drink. I have been known to visit each cider tent at least once.

Most of the exhibitors are stationed inside one of the many marquees whilst others are in the open. Compared to many craft fairs that are held throughout the summer months, the goods on offer are undoubtably a cut above the rest. If you are thinking of going to a summer fair, then this is the one to choose.

Apart from visiting the fair itself, the admission ticket give access to the beautiful Hole Park Estate Gardens.

This year the fair will be held on 7, 8 and 9 June. Further information including a video is available on the Wealden Times Web Site (click on the poster above left). The video will give you a good idea of what you can expect.
