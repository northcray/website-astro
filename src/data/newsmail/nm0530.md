Thanks to Jean Gammons for forwarding the following invitation from BOATE :

We hope you're enjoying our wonderful Summer and thanks for your support this year. Traditionally, BOATE have taken a break from Quizzes in July and August but this year we've decided to run a Summer Quiz night on the 1st August. We will have a Summer theme in some of the questions, a Summery raffle and I will be wearing my fancy Summer shirt. If you want to wear Hawaiian tops or shirts, hats, grass skirts or shorts, we could really get in the mood.

We hope you're able to join us and we would be grateful if you would book in and tell the pub if you plan to have a meal. The number of the pub is 020 8300 2590.

I look forward to welcoming you on 1st August

Kind Regards and Aloha
