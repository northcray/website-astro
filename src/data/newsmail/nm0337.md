Neighbourhound Watch

Thanks to Claire Tack - Secretary, Bexley Borough Neighbourhood Watch Association, for sending the following warning :

We have had another report of an aggressive dog in Foots Cray Meadows on Wednesday 15th November.

A man in his late 20's/early 30's with short dark hair was walking two Staffordshire Bull Terriers off the lead when one went to attack a Malinois puppy.

Fortunately the Staffie's owner called his dog off before the pup was injured. Please be vigilant when walking in the area.
