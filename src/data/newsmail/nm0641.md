Christingle at St James Church, North Cray

Thanks to Churchwarden, Suzy Higgs for sending the following invitation :

Sunday 9 December St James Church, North Cray 9.30am Family Christingle and Toy Service.

This service celebrates the light of Christ with oranges, candles, ribbons and the fruits of the earth and a collection for the work of the Children's Society.

The service will incorporate our Toy Service, where many of us like to bring a new toy which is then passed to the children at Bexley Women's Aid who provides support and refuge to women and children experiencing domestic abuse.

The service will be followed by "The Grand Christ Draw".
