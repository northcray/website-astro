### 1. Introduction

The North Cray Residents Association (NCRA) is committed to protecting the privacy of its members. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store your personal data in compliance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and other relevant legislation.

### 2. Who We Are

NCRA is a community organization dedicated to preserving the local environment and protecting the interests of North Cray residents. For any privacy-related inquiries, you can contact our Data Protection Officer (DPO).

### 3. What Data We Collect

We collect the following personal data from members:

- **First Name & Last Name** – to identify you as a member and for address verification when posting via Royal Mail.
- **Email Address** – to send updates, important notices, and transactional emails.
- **Postal Address** – to verify residency in the catchment area.
- **Payment Information** – handled by **our payment processor** for membership subscriptions (we do not store payment details).
- **Membership Status** – recorded in our self-hosted database.

_We also gather anonymized, aggregated website usage data through our web analytics service as detailed in Section 10 and 11; this service does not collect personal data._

---

### 4. How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

- Verify your residency in North Cray and confirm eligibility for membership.
- Provide membership benefits, including email updates on planning proposals and local issues.
- Send essential service communications via **our transactional email provider**, such as account setup emails (e.g., email verification, password resets) and important notifications.
- Maintain and administer our secure membership database.
- Ensure compliance with our subscription policies.
- Monitor and improve our website performance using aggregated analytics data from **our privacy-focused web analytics service** that does not collect personal data.

### 5. Mailing List & Legitimate Interest

When you subscribe as a member, we will automatically add your email to our **private members-only mailing list** (managed via **our mailing list provider**). This is based on **legitimate interest**, as we need to keep members informed about planning proposals and local issues relevant to their membership.

You can unsubscribe at any time using the link provided in our emails.
If you unsubscribe but later wish to rejoin, you must contact us.
This is separate from transactional emails sent via **our transactional email provider**, which are for essential account management.

### 6. Legal Basis for Processing

We process your personal data based on:

- **Legitimate Interest** – to inform members about planning proposals and local matters, to send essential service notifications, and to understand website usage patterns for service improvement (using anonymized data).
- **Contractual Necessity** – to verify eligibility for membership, process subscriptions, and manage your account (e.g., sending account setup and password reset emails).

You can opt out of non-essential (marketing) emails at any time. Transactional emails are essential for account operation.
